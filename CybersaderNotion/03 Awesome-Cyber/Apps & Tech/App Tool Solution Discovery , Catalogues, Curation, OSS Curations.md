Here you can be sure that the results can usually be good because the monetary model makes it so that the business doesn’t have to solve the researching problem in weird ways (contributions, mass reviews, etc.).  In theory and hopefully practice, this is a good way to bring knowledge to people.  However, it has the inherent flaw of only providing knowledge to those who have already obtained enough value in their solutions (they have enough money to pay for this research). This means that those solution-makers or businesses that need such knowledge to finalize their solution will sometimes never come to fruition.  It's a dilemma.  To obtain entrance to such knowledge, one must work with what they have available to them.
