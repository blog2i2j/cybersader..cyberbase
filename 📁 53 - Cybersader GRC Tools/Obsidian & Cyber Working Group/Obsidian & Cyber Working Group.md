If anyone uses or is interested in Obsidian for cyber or GRC stuff, DM me (or I can drop the link) to join the Discord / GitHub working group.  All of this will be open-source sometime over the summer, but they've been taking awhile to build - mostly because I'm not an actual developer.

Some open-source resources I've been building:
- **Starter vaults & templates** for SecOps, GRC, and personal branding (includes plugins and readmes for how to use them)
- **Framework crosswalk engine** — crosswalks/maps and translates NIST, CIS, ISO, etc., into linked Markdown pages so you can evidence-map, explore, and automate straight from plaintext notes.  I'm already 1500 lines of Python code in on this one.  Way harder than expected.  So far, I've got MITRE ATT&CK + D3FEND + ENGAGE, NIST800-53, CSFv2, CISv8, and the CRI Profile started.
- **Meta-framework for organizing notes** - helps solve the same age-old problem that libraries face with organizing books but with a modern overhaul ("where do I put this note").  Helps you decide how to structure your wiki/knowledge platform no matter the situation.  

GRC involves a lot of knowledge work; keeping structured frameworks side-by-side with the knowledge we input, utilize, and share could change how we do that type of work.

The attached image below shows an early example of what all this starts to look like with linked notes.
