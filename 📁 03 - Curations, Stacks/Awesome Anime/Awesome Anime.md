- [x] Update anime list 🔽 ➕ 2024-04-26 ✅ 2024-07-16
- I've watched anime at https://www.wcopremium.tv/

- New Animes
	- I Parry Everything (as of Ep1)
		- Seems wholesome
		- Any work can be noble work if it is done with a noble heart
	- The Unwanted Undead Adventurer
	- The Apothecary Diaries - not bad...shallow philosophies though
	- The Elusive Samurai
		- Has a good rating and hopefully wholesome
	- The Trillion Game - actually related to IT and hacking
	- Solo Leveling - ehhh...has some vengeance type vibes - with great power comes great responsibility.  Amazing animation and action.
