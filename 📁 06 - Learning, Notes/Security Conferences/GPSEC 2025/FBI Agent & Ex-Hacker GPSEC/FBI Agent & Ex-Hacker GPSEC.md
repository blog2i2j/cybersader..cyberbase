 - They hacked lots of people and found other hackers trying the same things
 - Lolsec was about hacking security companies to show them they didn't know they were doing
 - FBI didn't have Splunk to go through logs
 - Sabu got caught by clicking on a link
 - Sabu forgot to init his SSH tunnels and clicked on something which logged his access to a web shell
 - FBI surveillance is good 
 - Ransomware operators and threat actors have full fledged businesses with benefits.  They are oiled machines and it works because the internet doesn't have borders
 - Zero days used to be free for friends, but now it's a market and people don't do that for free because of trust issues
 - Hacks on Friday 4PM
