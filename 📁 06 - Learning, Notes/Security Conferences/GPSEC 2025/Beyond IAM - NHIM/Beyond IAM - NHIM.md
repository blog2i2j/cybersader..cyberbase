- not just service accounts
- AI and automation 
- access an entitlement around NHIs
- NHIs don't interact to alert you unless automated.  Governance without visibility or a mesh for it is hard
- why not just IAM and PAM.  MFA and conditional access for APIs.  Fragmented ownership makes this really hard.  Doesnt line up with existing tool quite well
- look at deproviosing automation with HR tooling
- the part they automate is finding the owners
- this is all really applicable with ITSM and devops tooling - more applicable with large scale containers
- best practice
	- assign owners to all
	- consumers and data flow
	- rotation and expiration
	- integrate with ci/CD
	- monitor usage and decommission unused ones
- if it can be stopped at the account for doing access control, then do that instead of something like a gateway at the application
- bridge between infra, dev, and automation - language barriers
