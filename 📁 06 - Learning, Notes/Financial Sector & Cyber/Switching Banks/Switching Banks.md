# Switching Banks: a distilled, no-nonsense guide

This is everything you need to cover when moving day-to-day banking from one institution to another—what to move, which payment rails to use, how verification works, and how to avoid hiccups. It’s generic on purpose (no bank names).

---

## 1) Terms (really quick)

- **Checking**: everyday spending account; typically where direct deposits land and bills pull from.
- **Savings**: parked cash; may be linked for overdraft.
- **External transfer** (what many apps call it): usually **ACH**.
- **ACH**: U.S. batch system for bank-to-bank transfers. Usually 1–3 business days; low or no fees; limits vary.
- **Wire**: real-time, final settlement on business days; fees apply.
- **RTP/FedNow**: newer instant rails; limited availability; often capped and not offered for large external moves.
- **Cashier’s check**: bank-issued check you can deposit at the new bank; subject to funds-availability holds.

---

## 2) Pick how you’ll move the money

**A. ACH (“External Transfer”) — default for most moves**

- **When**: Not urgent, cost-sensitive, routine or large but not time-critical.
- **Pros**: Usually free, can schedule, can split into multiple days.
- **Cons**: Per-day/month limits; 1–3 business days; not instant.
- **How**: Link accounts (instant login or micro-deposits), then **push** from old bank or **pull** from the new bank (pulls often have higher inbound limits).

**B. Wire — one-and-done, same-day on weekdays**

- **When**: Time-critical or you want finality now.
- **Pros**: Fast and final once sent; good for large single moves.
- **Cons**: Fees; processed only on business days before cutoff; separate setup (beneficiary details).
- **Note**: Wire routing numbers often **differ** from ACH routing numbers—use the new bank’s specific wire instructions.

**C. Cashier’s check — branch route**

- **When**: You’re visiting a branch anyway or want to avoid digital limits.
- **Pros**: Simple paper handoff.
- **Cons**: New/large-deposit holds at the receiving bank; not ideal if you need funds immediately.

**Practical combo**: Wire the big chunk on a weekday, then ACH the remainder (or leave a small buffer for a billing cycle).

---

## 3) Timing, limits, and “why is my money not usable yet?”

- **ACH speed**: Standard 1–3 business days; some banks offer Same-Day ACH but still may delay **availability** for risk checks.
- **ACH limits**: Vary by customer; shown in your transfer screen. If too low, request a temporary increase **or** initiate the transfer **from the receiving bank** (pull).
- **Wire timing**: Same-day if before cutoff; otherwise next business day. Weekends/holidays don’t process.
- **Funds availability (holds)**:
	- Electronic deposits are often available quickly, but **new accounts** and **large deposits** can face risk-based holds.
	- Cashier’s checks and other checks can be held for several business days depending on policy.
	- Ask your new bank’s **Funds Availability** policy for specifics before you move the big amount.

---

## 4) Verification you’ll encounter (by rail/use case)

- **Linking accounts for ACH**
	- **Instant verification** (secure login to the other bank); or
	- **Micro-deposits** (two small credits appear; you confirm amounts).
- **Sending a wire**
	- Enter **beneficiary name**, **account number**, **wire routing number**, and address; may require extra security prompts.
- **Direct deposit (employer/benefits)**
	- Fill out a direct deposit form with **routing + account**; some employers request a **voided check**.
	- Changes often take **1–2 payroll cycles**; don’t shut the old account prematurely.
- **Lenders (mortgage/auto/student)**
	- If they **pull** via ACH, update your bank info in their portal and **confirm a test draft** date if offered.
- **Subscriptions/utilities/insurance**
	- Update bank info or card on file; some portals re-verify via $0 or $1 authorization or 3-D Secure prompts.
- **Payment apps/wallets (PayPal, Venmo, etc.)**
	- Re-link the new bank; may do instant verify or micro-deposits.
- **Government benefits/tax refunds**
	- Update routing/account in the agency portal well ahead of the next payout.

## 5) Repoint *everything* (checklist by flow)

**Inflows**

- Employer payroll / contractor platforms
- Government benefits (e.g., SSA)
- Tax refunds (update on your next filing)
- Transfers from brokerage/fintech apps that push to your bank

**Outflows**

- Mortgage/loan autopay (any lender that **pulls** from your account)
- Credit card autopays
- Utilities (electric/gas/water), internet/mobile
- Insurance premiums (auto/home/health/life)
- Subscriptions (streaming, productivity, gaming, cloud storage)
- Bill pay **payees** (if you used the old bank’s bill pay)

**Cards & wallets**

- Card-on-file at merchants and wallet apps (Apple/Google/PayPal/Amazon, etc.)

**Linked/connected services**

- Budgeting/aggregation tools (Monarch, YNAB, etc.)
- Payroll/HR portals (for you as a manager)
- Any app that had data-sharing consent (revoke at the old bank if you’re leaving it)

---

## 6) Risk, reversals, and safeguards

- **ACH**: Can be **returned** by the receiving bank within defined windows; consumers can dispute **unauthorized debits** (you have time to report). Credits are harder to claw back—treat details carefully.
- **Wires**: **Final** once processed. A recall is a courtesy request only—assume no reversal. Double-check recipient details.
- **Fraud hygiene**:
	- Get wire instructions **directly** from the new bank portal/secure message; beware spoofed emails.
	- Turn on **alerts** at both banks (large transfers, new payees).
	- Don’t send test amounts to strangers; use official rails only.
- **Regulatory flags**: Don’t “split up” transactions to avoid internal reviews. If a bank asks for source/use of funds, provide documentation.

---

## 7) Clean closure—without breaking anything

1. **Open the new account**; confirm availability policies and instant-verification options.
2. **Link both ways** (old ↔ new); do a small test ACH.
3. **Move the bulk** (ACH over a few days **or** one weekday wire).
4. **Leave a buffer** in the old account for **1–2 statement cycles** to catch stragglers (outstanding checks, refunds, delayed ACH debits).
5. **Repoint inflows/outflows** using the checklist above; confirm the first successful payroll and the first autopays.
6. **Audit for stragglers**: scan the last 3–12 months of statements for annual/odd-cycle charges.
7. **Disconnect bill pay** at the old bank; cancel autopays that pull from it.
8. **Close the old account** per instructions; get **written confirmation**. Shred old checks; destroy old debit card.
9. **After closing**: make sure any refunds/chargebacks are going to an active card/account (merchants usually credit the original card).

---

## 8) Edge cases people forget

- **Outstanding paper checks**: Don’t close until you’re sure they’ve cleared or you’ve issued **stop payments** and re-issued from the new account.
- **Overdraft protection**: If your checking used a savings/LOC, update or disable at the old bank.
- **Safe deposit box**: Empty and close separately.
- **Joint accounts / authorized users**: Everyone must update direct deposits/autopays.
- **Account titles & beneficiaries**: Re-add **POD/beneficiaries** on new accounts.
- **Early closure fees**: Some banks charge if you close very soon after opening—check terms.
- **Credit cards**: Bank switch doesn’t move your **credit card**; update its **autopay funding account** only.
- **Refunds to closed cards**: Merchants generally refund to the original card; if that card/account is closed, the bank should still route it to you—but it’s smoother if the card remains open until after expected returns.

---

## 9) Quick decision tree (print-worthy)

- **Need the money today?** → **Wire** (weekday, fee).
- **Okay with 1–3 business days & want free?** → **ACH external transfer** (push *or* pull; ask for a temporary limit bump if needed).
- **Going to a branch & fine with a hold?** → **Cashier’s check**.
- **Moving everything** → Combine: wire big chunk + ACH for leftovers + keep a buffer until quiet.

---

## 10) Minimal templates you’ll use

- **Direct deposit**: “Routing: \_\_\_\_ Account: \_\_\_\_ Type: Checking Amount: 100% (or split) Start date: next payroll.”
- **Wire recipient (to your new bank)**: Bank name, **wire routing** (not ACH), your name & address, your **account number**.
- **ACH micro-deposit verify**: Two small credits from the other bank/app → enter exact amounts in your old bank or new bank portal.
