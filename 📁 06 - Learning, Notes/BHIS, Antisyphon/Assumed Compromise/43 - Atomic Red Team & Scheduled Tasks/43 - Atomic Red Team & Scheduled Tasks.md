[PowerShell for InfoSec](../../../Cyber%20Classes/PowerShell%20for%20InfoSec/PowerShell%20for%20InfoSec.md) - class I took from Carrie Roberts (head architect of Atomic Red Team) 

- Emulate attacks and check detections
- ART is one of the most maintained tools around BHIS

- Reverse seed searching
	- Make an attack with a really unique name for the command or whatever, run the attack, then use that unique term as you look through logs
- If your SIEM doesn't have it, then you can use this process to build detections
