What we’re proposing are changes to U.S. export rules that would allow additional countries to access U.S. compute on the condition that their datacenters don’t rely on PRC technology that present\\[s\\] security risks — instead of restricting their access to chips based on the assumption that they will divert technology to the PRC. The goal is more compute and more AI for more countries and more people.”

In a [new policy proposal](https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ostp-rfi/ec680b75-d539-4653-b297-8bcf6e5f7686/openai-response-ostp-nsf-rfi-notice-request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan.pdf), OpenAI describes Chinese AI lab [DeepSeek](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/) as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from the outfit and similar People’s Republic of China (PRC)-supported operations.

The proposal, a [submission](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/openai-lobbies-trump-admin-to-focus-ai-on-speed-light-regulation.html) for the Trump administration’s “[AI Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/02/public-comment-invited-on-artificial-intelligence-action-plan/)” initiative, claims that DeepSeek’s models, including its [R1 “reasoning” model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/), are insecure because DeepSeek faces requirements under Chinese law to comply with demands for user data. Banning the use of “PRC-produced” models in all countries considered “Tier 1” under the [Biden administration’s export rules](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/biden-administration-proposes-sweeping-new-restrictions-on-exporting-ai-chips/) would prevent privacy and “security risks,” OpenAI says, including the “risk of IP theft.”

It’s unclear whether OpenAI’s references to “models” are meant to refer to DeepSeek’s API, the lab’s open models, or both. DeepSeek’s open models don’t contain mechanisms that would allow the Chinese government to siphon user data; companies including [Microsoft](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/microsoft-brings-a-deepseek-model-to-its-cloud/), [Perplexity](https://www.pcmag.com/news/deepseek-is-here-to-stay-as-microsoft-perplexity-integrate-its-model), and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/deepseek-r1-models-now-available-on-aws/) host them on their infrastructure.

OpenAI has [previously accused](https://www.theverge.com/news/601195/openai-evidence-deepseek-distillation-ai-data) DeepSeek, which rose to prominence earlier this year, of “distilling” knowledge from OpenAI’s models against its terms of service. But OpenAI’s new allegations — that DeepSeek is supported by the PRC and under its command — are an escalation of the company’s campaign against the Chinese lab.

There isn’t a clear link between the Chinese government and DeepSeek, a spin-off from a quantitative hedge fund called High-Flyer. However, the PRC has taken an increased interest in DeepSeek in recent months. Several weeks ago, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng [met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/deepseek-founder-liang-wenfeng-is-reportedly-set-to-meet-with-chinas-xi-jinping/).

_Updated 3/15 8:38 p.m. Pacific: Days after this story was published, OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeois sent the following statement_:

_“We’re not advocating for restrictions on people using models like DeepSeek. What we’re proposing are changes to U.S. export rules that would allow additional countries to access U.S. compute on the condition that their datacenters don’t rely on PRC technology that present\[s\] security risks — instead of restricting their access to chips based on the assumption that they will divert technology to the PRC. The goal is more compute and more AI for more countries and more people.”_

_OpenAI’s own AI-powered deep research tool [characterizes the above statement](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d648ab-da6c-800c-ab03-f7d7a9909059) as “equivocal, employing deflective and softening language that partially contradicts the stronger stance documented in \[the company’s\] original submission.”
