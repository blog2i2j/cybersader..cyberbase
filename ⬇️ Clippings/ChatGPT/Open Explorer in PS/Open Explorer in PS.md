How to open file explorer at cli point in PS

---

**AI:**

You can open File Explorer directly from the PowerShell CLI using the following command:

```
explorer .
```

This command will open the current directory in File Explorer. If you'd like to open a specific directory, just replace the `.` with the path of the directory you want to open. For example:

```
explorer C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
```

This will open the "Documents" folder in File Explorer.
