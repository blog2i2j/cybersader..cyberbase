What's the best mic for value when I'm starting a YouTube channel or want to talk to people. And do I have to be close to this Mic. I also really don't like the mics that catch things like keyboard clacks and chair creaking

---

**AI:**

For starting a YouTube channel or talking to people while minimizing background noise like keyboard clacks and chair creaks, you’ll want a dynamic microphone with good off-axis rejection. Here are some of the best value options:

### **Best Value Dynamic Microphones**

1. **Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB (~$80-$100)**
	- USB & XLR (flexibility for upgrading)
	- Good background noise rejection
	- Works well close up (~4-6 inches from mouth)
2. **Shure MV7 (~$200, but a solid investment)**
	- USB & XLR
	- More forgiving on positioning than traditional dynamic mics
	- Built-in processing for noise rejection
3. **Samson Q2U (~$60-$80)**
	- USB & XLR
	- Great budget pick
	- Requires you to be close (~4 inches for best quality)
4. **Rode PodMic (~$100, XLR only, requires an audio interface)**
	- Excellent sound for the price
	- Needs an audio interface (like a Focusrite Scarlett Solo)
	- Good rejection of background noise

### **Alternative: Headset or Shotgun Mic?**

- If you want more freedom to move around and still avoid background noise, a **broadcast headset mic** like the **Audio-Technica BPHS1** or **Shure BRH31M** is an option.
- A **shotgun mic** (like the **Rode NTG4+**) works at a short distance but may still pick up keyboard clacks.

### **Do You Have to Be Close?**

- **Dynamic Mics:** Yes, you generally need to be within **3-6 inches** for the best sound. Being further away lowers volume and can pick up more room noise.
- **Shotgun Mics:** Can work at a slight distance (12-24 inches) but still may catch noises.
- **Lavalier Mics:** Clip-on options like the **Rode Lavalier Go** can be useful if you move around but may not isolate sound as well.

### **What to Avoid**

- **Blue Yeti** or other condenser mics (too sensitive, pick up everything)
- **Cheap USB desk mics** that don’t have good noise rejection

For your needs (blocking out noise, clear voice, good value), the **ATR2100x-USB** or **Samson Q2U** are great starter choices. If you want a long-term investment, the **Shure MV7** is excellent.

What's the best mic for someone who types on a keyboard a lot and have a reverby room. I'm willing to spend a bit of money for an amp if need be too. Sm7db might be the best option to avoid an expensive amplifier though. The mv6 aint bad either

---

**AI:**

Based on what you’ve described—a room with a lot of reverb and keyboard noise—you’ll want a mic that naturally rejects off-axis sounds. Here are some points to consider:

### **Dynamic vs. Digital (USB) Options**

- **Shure SM7B (Dynamic):**  
	• **Noise Rejection:** The SM7B is renowned for its ability to isolate your voice while largely ignoring room noise and incidental keyboard clacks. Its dynamic design makes it popular in studios and broadcast settings.  
	• **Gain Requirements:** It does require a good amount of gain. In many cases, users add a preamp booster like a Cloudlifter or a high-quality audio interface with plenty of clean gain. This extra cost can be worth it if you’re looking for the best control over your sound in a reverby environment.  
	• **Usage:** You generally need to be close to the mic (around 4–6 inches) to maximize its benefits and further minimize ambient noise.
- **Shure MV6 (Digital/USB):**  
	• **Ease of Use:** The MV6 is a more plug‐and‐play solution. It offers both USB and XLR connectivity, meaning you can use it straight out of the box without worrying about a separate preamp.  
	• **Performance in Untreated Rooms:** While it’s a solid performer, its built-in preamp and condenser design can be a bit more sensitive to room reflections and keyboard sounds.  
	• **Trade-Off:** You may sacrifice a little bit of the “room rejection” that a dynamic mic like the SM7B offers, but you avoid the extra investment in external amplification.

### **Room and Keyboard Noise Considerations**

- **Room Treatment:**  
	Even the best mic can pick up unwanted reflections in a reverby room. If possible, consider some basic acoustic treatments or a reflection filter behind the mic. This can help both with dynamic and USB mics.
- **Mic Technique:**  
	Positioning is key. Keeping the mic close to your mouth (using a pop filter and proper isolation shield) further minimizes ambient noise, regardless of which mic you choose.

### **Which One to Choose?**

- **If You’re Willing to Invest in an Amp/Preamp:**  
	The **Shure SM7B** is often considered the gold standard for spoken word applications in challenging acoustic environments. Its design naturally minimizes background noise, but it will need a quality preamp (or Cloudlifter) to deliver optimal results.
- **If You Prefer Simplicity & Lower Setup Costs:**  
	The **Shure MV6** provides a very convenient, all-in-one solution with decent noise rejection. It might not be as robust in rejecting room noise as the SM7B, but its built-in processing can be sufficient if you don’t want to spend on additional gear.

### **Conclusion**

For a space with lots of keyboard clacking and reverb, many professionals lean toward the SM7B paired with an appropriate preamp because its dynamic design offers superior isolation of your voice. However, if you’d rather avoid the extra cost and setup complexity of an external amplifier, the MV6 remains a solid, value-friendly choice.

For more detailed comparisons and user experiences, several online discussions and reviews support these points, noting that dynamic mics like the SM7B typically outperform in noisy or reverberant conditions, whereas USB mics like the MV6 are excellent for straightforward setups.
