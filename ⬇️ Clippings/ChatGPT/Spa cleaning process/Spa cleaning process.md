Give me the play by play on how to clean and then fill this thing. Right now I've got some vinegar and I have all the chlorine and stuff but I don't have the sequestering things for minerals or enzymes. I feel like I'll have to fill up and then empty it though at least once and I also don't have a line cleaner for cleaning out the lines of it.

Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step so you don’t miss anything. Since you don’t have the full spa chemical kit (enzymes, sequestering agents, line flush, etc.), I’ll give you a play-by-play that gets it clean enough to safely use while leaving room to do a more thorough clean later when you get the extras.

---

## Step 1: Prep Before Filling

1. **Inspect the shell & jets**
	- Wipe down the inside with a vinegar + water solution (50/50).
	- Use a soft cloth or sponge, not abrasive.
	- Check the jets for gunk — a toothbrush and vinegar can help loosen buildup.
2. **Clean the filter housing**
	- Rinse the cylindrical filters thoroughly with a hose.
	- Soak them in a vinegar solution if they look grimy.
	- Don’t reinstall until after you’ve done the first flush/fill cycle.
3. **Check drains & sump**
	- Make sure the drain is closed properly before filling.

---

## Step 2: Quick First Fill & Flush

Since you don’t have a **line cleaner**, do a quick flush to push out whatever’s been sitting inside.

1. **Fill halfway with a garden hose** (ideally through the filter compartment, so water goes into the lines).
2. **Circulate for 20–30 minutes**
	- If you can, run jets on low/high briefly to move water through.
	- This will push out dust, gunk, and residual water that’s been sitting.
3. **Drain completely**
	- Use your sump pump (yes, that S3033 1/3 HP sump pump works perfectly — just don’t run it dry).
	- Wipe out any loosened grime.

---

## Step 3: Main Fill

1. **Place hose in filter compartment** (ensures air is pushed out of the lines as it fills).
2. **Fill to recommended level** (usually halfway up the skimmer opening).
3. **Bleed the pumps** if needed (some models trap air — check your manual for a bleed valve if the jets don’t start).

---

## Step 4: Startup Chemicals (Basic Set)

Since you don’t have sequestering agents or enzymes yet, here’s the *bare minimum startup*:

1. **Add Chlorine**
	- Shock dose (3–4 tsp dichlor granules if using that type).
	- Circulate for at least 20–30 min with cover open.
2. **Check pH & Alkalinity**
	- Vinegar wipe won’t do much here; you’ll need test strips.
	- Ideal: pH 7.2–7.6, Alkalinity 80–120 ppm.
	- If way off, adjust with pH up/down later.
3. **Run jets** for 15–20 minutes after adding chemicals.

---

## Step 5: Wait & Balance

- Let water circulate for a few hours.
- Retest chlorine & pH.
- If balanced, you’re safe to soak.

---

## Step 6: What To Do Later (Once You Get Extras)

- **Line Cleaner**: Next drain cycle, run something like Spa System Flush before draining.
- **Sequestering Agent**: Add on fresh fills to prevent mineral buildup/stains (especially if you have hard water).
- **Enzymes**: Help break down oils/lotions so filters last longer.

---

✅ **Bottom Line:**  
Do one quick vinegar wipe + half-fill flush + full fill with chlorine startup. It won’t be a “perfectly clean, showroom-ready spa,” but it’ll be sanitary enough to use right away. Then plan for a *true deep clean* (line flush, sequestering, enzyme) at your first real drain/refill in 2–3 months.

---

Do you want me to make you a **shopping list with both “bare minimum now” and “next fill must-haves”** so you’re not overbuying?

##### You said:

Can I buy any line cleaner?

###### ChatGPT said:

Pretty much, yes — but there are a couple of details worth knowing before you grab just anything off the shelf.

---

## 🔹 What a Line Cleaner Is

Line cleaners (sometimes sold as **“spa flush,” “system flush,” or “plumbing cleaner”**) are products designed to break down and loosen biofilm, oils, and gunk that sit in the plumbing lines while the spa is drained or unused. Chlorine *by itself* won’t remove biofilm in lines — that’s why the special cleaner is useful at least once per year (ideally every drain/refill).

---

## 🔹 Things to Look For

1. **Specifically for hot tubs/spas**
	- Don’t use pool line cleaners (too harsh, foamy, or not meant for small-volume hot water).
	- Spa versions are safe for acrylic, jets, and pumps.
2. **Common, trusted brands**
	- *Ahh-Some Hot Tub Plumbing & Jet Cleaner* (super strong, small gel container).
	- *Leisure Time Jet Clean*.
	- *Spa Purge (Natural Chemistry)*.
	- *Oh Yuk Healthy Hot Tub Cleaner*.
3. **Foaming behavior**
	- Some make lots of foam (messy if you overdo it). A sump pump helps with cleanup afterward.
4. **Use before draining**
	- You add it, run jets 15–30 minutes, let sit (per instructions), then drain completely.

---

## 🔹 Where to Buy

- **In-person:** Lowe’s, Home Depot, Leslie’s Pool Supplies, spa/hot tub dealers.
- **Online:** Amazon, Walmart, specialty spa supply stores.

---

✅ **Answer:** You can’t just grab *any* plumbing cleaner, but any **spa-specific line cleaner** will work fine. If you want the strongest/most recommended one, **Ahh-Some** is the go-to in the hot tub community. If you want easy to find, **Leisure Time Jet Clean** is usually stocked at big-box stores.

---

Do you want me to give you a **step-by-step on how to use it with your sump pump** the next time you drain, so you don’t make a foamy mess?

##### You said:

What about metal sequestrant?

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question 👍 — metal sequestrants are a different category than line cleaners, and they’re really important *if your water source has iron, copper, or manganese* (well water is the big culprit, but even some city supplies have trace metals).

---

## 🔹 What a Metal Sequestrant Does

- **Prevents staining & scale** → Metals can cause brown/green staining on the shell, and calcium scale can leave white crusty buildup.
- **Holds metals in suspension** so your filter can catch them instead of plating onto surfaces.
- Doesn’t *remove* metals — it just keeps them from sticking until they can be filtered/removed at a water change.

---

## 🔹 What to Look For

1. **Hot tub/spa specific** (don’t buy a pool-only formula — those are often more concentrated and not balanced for hot tub volumes).
2. **Phosphonic acid based** is common (stays effective longer).
3. Avoid “copper-based” algaecides marketed as metal removers — they actually *add* metals.

**Trusted spa brands:**

- *Leisure Time Metal Gon* (classic one-time add at fill-up).
- *Leisure Time Defender* (more for scale, but helps with metals).
- *Natural Chemistry Spa Metal Free* (non-phosphate, enzyme-friendly).
- *ProTeam Metal Magic* (stronger, doubles as scale remover).

---

## 🔹 When & How to Use

1. **Right after filling** (before you shock with chlorine).
	- Add the recommended dose while jets are running.
	- This gives it a chance to bind metals before chlorine oxidizes them (oxidized iron = rust stains).
2. **One-time per fill** — most products last until the next drain/refill.
	- Some people re-dose monthly if water is very metal-heavy.
3. **If you skip it**
	- You might be fine if your water is very “clean.”
	- But if you see cloudy water, orange/brown stains, or white crust on jets, that’s your sign you needed it.

---

## 🔹 Where to Buy

- **In-person:** Pool/spa stores, Leslie’s, sometimes Home Depot/Lowe’s in spa aisle.
- **Online:** Amazon, InTheSwim, HotTubWarehouse.

---

✅ **Answer:** You don’t *need* a sequestrant if your water has little/no metals, but it’s cheap insurance — especially at fill-up. **Leisure Time Metal Gon** is the go-to “set it and forget it” option for spas.

---

Do you know if your water source is **well water or city water**? That’ll change whether I recommend you *must use* a sequestrant or if it’s more of a “nice-to-have.”
