##### You said:

Mosquitto stuff I could put next to hot tub that would ACTUALLY do somethin?

###### ChatGPT said:

If you mean actual *mosquito-repelling* things you could set up around your hot tub (instead of MQTT/Mosquitto, the IoT broker 😅), here are categories that actually do something:

---

## 1\. Passive Barriers

- **Mosquito netting / curtains**: If you add a pergola or frame, you can hang outdoor mosquito curtains. They physically block insects.
- **Water-safe covers**: A fitted cover for the hot tub when not in use prevents mosquitoes from being attracted to the warm water.

---

## 2\. Repellents & Deterrents

- **Thermacell devices**: Butane-powered or rechargeable units that create a “zone” of repellent. They’re portable and effective for patio/hot tub use.
- **Citronella torches or candles**: Work in close proximity but are weaker than Thermacell.
- **Essential-oil diffusers (outdoor grade)**: Some people run citronella/lemongrass diffusers under a pergola.

---

## 3\. Active Control

- **CO₂ mosquito traps**: Units like *Mosquito Magnet* lure and trap mosquitoes using CO₂ and attractants. They cover a yard rather than just the tub.
- **UV light zappers**: Mixed effectiveness (kill many bugs but not always mosquitoes), but can reduce general annoyance.
- **Fan-based traps**: Strong patio fans pull in mosquitoes and dry them out. Bonus: fans also keep mosquitoes away since they can’t fly well in moving air.

---

## 4\. Habitat Control

- **Eliminate standing water nearby**: Buckets, planters, and even hot tub covers that pool water are breeding sites.
- **Mosquito dunks (BTI tablets)**: If you have decorative water nearby, dropping these kills larvae safely.

---

## 5\. Tech/Smart Home Angle

Since you like smart systems:

- You *could* integrate smart switches to only turn on repellents (like Thermacell LIV or outdoor zappers) when you’re in the hot tub.
- Motion or presence detection (via Home Assistant + Zigbee sensor) → triggers fan + repeller combo automatically.

---

👉 For something you can put **right next to the tub and it actually works**, a **Thermacell rechargeable repeller** or a **patio fan pointed at the tub** are probably the most effective + simple.

Do you want me to sketch you a **smart setup** where Home Assistant automates a combo of fan + repeller whenever you enter hot tub mode? That would tie the “Mosquitto” IoT side into your mosquito problem.

In terms of thermacell, best one?

If you're looking for the best **Thermacell repeller** to use near your hot tub—something effective, convenient, and suited to your outdoor setup—here's a breakdown based on recent reviews, user feedback, and product features:

---

## What Experts and Reviews Say

- **Thermacell E-Series (E55/E90)** — The rechargeable models offer a **20-ft protective zone**, silent, odorless operation, and are highly praised.
	- *Business Insider* calls the **E55** “highly effective” with a compact design, ~5–5.5 hours battery life, and long-lasting cartridges.
	- A *SFGate* review notes the **E-Series Rechargeable** as an “upgrade pick,” emphasizing its **chemical-free, 20-feet-radius protection**.
- **Thermacell Patio Shield Lantern** — A fuel-powered lantern that radiates repellent over around **177 sq ft** (roughly a 12-hour run time). *Better Homes & Gardens* found that during testing, “no mosquitoes were noticed in the zone of protection … nor did we experience any bites.”

## Real-World Comparison from Enthusiasts

A Reddit user breaks down the trade-offs between Thermacell models:

> “If you need more than 6 hours then the backpacker or MR300 is the way to go. … the 6.4 ounce MR300 is the way to go. And it’s the cheapest.”  
> — r/Ultralight

Highlights:

- **MR300**:
	- Lightweight (~6.4 oz)
	- Butane-fueled, ~12 hours of run time per cartridge
	- Low cost per hour with larger refill packs
- **Backpacker**:
	- Even lighter (~4 oz), but needs separate fuel canisters
	- Similar cost of operation to MR300, depending on fuel access

## Key Takeaways by Scenario

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Why It Stands Out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple, quiet, chemical-free rechargeability** | **E-Series (E55 or E90)** | Rechargeable, odorless, 20-ft zone, effective and well-reviewed, safe for a relaxing hot tub setting. |
| **Longer run-time per charge** | **E90 (enhanced battery life)** | Same footprint as E55, but up to 9-hour runtime — ideal for extended hot tub sessions. |
| **Fuel-powered for extended coverage without recharge** | **Patio Shield Lantern** | Covers a wide area (~177 sq ft) for 12 hours, lantern style fits well beside a hot tub. |
| **Portable, lightweight, budget-friendly** | **MR300** | Excellent weight-to-hour ratio, inexpensive operational cost. |
