I'm lurking for some good laundry baskets that aren't made by a bunch of badly treated people in China. In other words American is what I'm looking for USA made in the USA. I like functionality modularity practicality. Don't just pick something Make sure it's long-term solution flexible in that it can fit in multiple places don't have to bend over to pick it up things like that. Be creative Preferably mostly cloth bag or something foldable that can go into something that rolls too. Handles that can hang too

Below is a field-tested shortlist of American-made laundry solutions that balance heavy-duty construction with real-world flexibility. Each pick comes from a factory that actually cuts, sews, welds, or molds its products in the U S A, so you’re not outsourcing the job—or the labor standards—overseas. I’ve split them into rolling “trucks” (for zero-bend pickup and easy mobility) and standalone cloth bags you can clip onto a cart, hang on a hook, or stuff in a closet. Mix-and-match them to create a modular system that suits apartments, basements, or a mobile laundry day run.

## What makes a hamper “future-proof”?

| Design target | Why it matters | Sample spec to look for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rolling & elevated** | Eliminates repetitive bending and lets the basket follow you room-to-room | 21-in+ handle height; 4” rubber casters |
| **Removable cloth liner** | Lets you grab just the bag, or toss it in the wash | #10 or #12 duck canvas or 500-denier nylon |
| **Rigid frame rails** | Prevents sagging when bag is stuffed | Powder-coated steel or TIG-welded wire |
| **Fold-flat / nesting** | Saves closet space when not in use | Telescoping legs or quick-release bag straps |
| **Hang points** | For doors or wall hooks when floor space vanishes | Reinforced grommets or webbing loops |

*(criteria distilled from pro-organizer and editor testing notes)*

## Heavy-duty rolling hampers

**Steele Canvas** — Cambridge, MA

- Family-owned for 100 + years; every truck, basket and caddy is sewn and welded in Massachusetts
- #92 Elevated Rolling Basket: steel frame + #8 duck canvas, 2–6 bushel sizes, replaceable wheels
- Small Rolling Basket: same build in a slimmer 1½-bushel footprint—great for tight bathrooms

**R&B Wire Products** — Santa Ana, CA

- Commercial-laundry workhorse since 1946; all carts bent, welded, and zinc-plated in-house
- Standard Capacity Wire Cart (model 100E): chrome-plated basket, optional double-pole hanging rack
- Antimicrobial or Collapsible versions if you need hospital-grade vinyl bags or fold-flat frames

**Dial Industries** — Stockton, CA

- Five decades of molding plastic housewares stateside; their tall “Flex” ventilated hamper fits 2–3 loads and nests when empty

## Stand-alone cloth bags & stuff sacks

**Owen Sewn 30×40 Canvas Bag** — heavy twill, holds ~50 lb, draw-cord with cord-lock; sewn in Illinois  
**Red Oxx “Laundro” Mesh Sack** — parachute-spec mesh + mil-grade webbing; folds to palm size; handmade in Montana with lifetime “No-Bull” warranty  
**Tom Bihn Travel Laundry Stuff Sack** — two-compartment divider so clean separates from dirty; cut and sewn in Seattle factory  
**Six Moon Designs Nylon Laundry Bag** — ultralight rip-stop option for backpack trips; sewn in Oregon

## Modular combos that work

| Scenario | Cart + Bag pairing | Why it shines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Laundry-room workhorse** | Steele #92 Elevated Truck + same-brand canvas liner | Wheel a week’s worth without stooping; liner snaps out to wash |
| **Apartment / closet** | R&B Collapsible Narrow Hamper frame + Tom Bihn sack | Frame folds flat; sack doubles as travel duffel |
| **Dorm & laundromat runs** | Dial Flex plastic hamper + Owen Sewn bag inside | Ventilated shell rolls down hall; canvas bag drags straight to machines |
| **Road-trip ready** | Red Oxx mesh bag + car trunk | Bag is sand-/mildew-proof, doubles as beach tote |

---

## Care & longevity tips

1. **Wash the liners, not the frame.** Canvas or nylon liners survive cold-water gentle cycles; line-dry to avoid shrink.
2. **Grease those casters.** A dab of silicone spray every 4-6 months stops the squeak and keeps roll-resistance low.
3. **Replace, don’t toss.** Steele and R&B both sell drop-in replacement bags and wheels, so the metal chassis can last decades.

**Pro-tip:** If floor real-estate is at a premium, buy one rolling chassis (Steele or R&B) and keep multiple cloth bags clipped in rotation—you’ll spend once on the metal and swap bags as chores or décor change over time.

##### You said:

Ideally it would have - foldability or space saving - modular in terms of being dropped into a rollable and also foldable cart - durable long term materials like canvas - metal frame (foldable) - in each modular part that goes into the cart you can use just the canvas part or with another structurally sound modular basket piece that goes into the part of the cart Does this exist?

###### ChatGPT said:

The short answer is **yes—but the true “Swiss-Army” setup lives in the commercial-laundry world, not the big-box aisle.** Two U.S. manufacturers—**Royal Basket Trucks** (Wisconsin) and **R&B Wire Products** (California)—build **fold-flat steel frames that accept removable canvas bags** and can be docked into (or upgraded into) wheeled basket trucks. Pair either frame with heavy-duty canvas liners from **Steele Canvas** (Massachusetts) and you get every box on your wish-list: foldability, modular drop-in bags, rollable carts, and long-wear materials that can be used separately or together. Below is the mix-and-match recipe.

---

## 1\. Core fold-flat frames

| Maker | Model | Why it fits the brief |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Royal Basket Trucks** | **Designer Chrome Hamper Kit (single or double)** | Nickel-chrome X-frame folds flat; ships with Velcro-on *canvas* bag; marketed as a “convenient and collapsible” design and made in Wisconsin |
| **R&B Wire Products** | **654 Collapsible X-Frame Hamper** | 1-inch tubular steel, folds to ~5 in for storage, accepts 30–35 gal reusable bags; optional 3-in casters convert it to a roll-around stand |
| **R&B Adjustable Collapsible Frame** | Width-adjusts from 18-25 in and locks; same fold-flat geometry; proudly “Made in USA” |  |

### Use-alone mode

Both frames sit 32-37 in high, so you can toss clothes in *without* bending. Pop the canvas sack out and carry it as a standalone laundry bag or hang it by its grommets.

---

## 2\. Rollable (and still foldable) carts

| Maker | Model | Key points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Royal Basket Trucks** | **Collapsible Basket Truck (wire base, 8–16 bu)** | Entire steel chassis folds, yet rolls on 4-in polyurethane casters; same Darien, WI factory; accepts the same Royal or Steele liners via Velcro/snaps |
| **R&B Wire** | **100E Standard Wire Cart** | Classic laundromat cart with bumper rim; rigid (not foldable) but mates perfectly with the R&B canvas bags above for wheel-around duty |

*Drop-in trick:* the canvas liner (or the whole X-frame) can ride inside the basket truck when you need wheels; when space is tight, collapse the truck and hang just the bag.

---

## 3\. Up-spec canvas liners & inserts

| Source | Canvas option | Why it’s worth adding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Steele Canvas** | #92 10-oz or 12-oz duck canvas bags—sold à-la-carte with grommet tabs | Industrial-laundry grade, replaceable, and sewn in Massachusetts |
| **Steele Elevated Truck bags** | Deeper, divider-ready inserts that can be lifted out by the rim | Same heavy canvas, sized from 2–6 bu; good if you later buy a non-folding Steele cart |
| **Steele Bag Caddie Bags** | Tall slim bags with spring steel rims—handy for closets or hooks | Works as a “bag only” compartment, then drops into either Royal or R&B frame |

Because all three brands use **grommets or Velcro tabs on 30-gal-class bags**, you can swap liners between frames without tools.

---

## 4\. How the modular workflow looks

1. **Home base:** keep a Royal Designer Hamper or R&B Collapsible X-Frame open in the bedroom—frame up, bag clipped in.
2. **Laundry day:** unclip the full canvas bag and set it inside the Royal Collapsible Basket Truck (or your preferred wheeled base).
3. **Tight on space?** Fold the X-frame and slide it behind a dresser; the basket truck itself folds flat when not in use.
4. **Optional dividers:** Steele’s split-compartment bags or a second bag in a different color give instant whites/darks sorting.
5. **Maintenance:** toss the canvas liner in a cold-wash cycle; hit the frame casters with silicone every few months for squeak-free rolling.

---

## 5\. Longevity & upgrade notes

- **Replace, don’t rebuy.** All three makers sell replacement bags, caster kits, and even new cross-bars—keeping the metal out of landfills for decades
- **Canvas care.** Mild detergent, air-dry; sparingly apply fabric wax if you want extra water-resistance.
- **Future add-ons.** Want lids or shelves? Royal and R&B both list bolt-on tray tops and hanging racks that retrofit onto the same base frames .

---

### Bottom line

By combining a **collapsible X-frame (Royal or R&B) + a heavy canvas liner (Steele or matching OEM) + an optional collapsible wheeled truck**, you get a U.S.-built system that folds away, rolls smoothly, lasts for decades, and lets every piece work solo or together—no back-breaking bending or disposable plastic required.
