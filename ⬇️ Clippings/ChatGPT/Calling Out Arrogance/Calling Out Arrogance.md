title: "Calling Out Arrogance"

##### You said:

If I'm facing someone arrogant who assumes I should know all the abstract terminology lingo and concepts and is impatient or doesn't want to bridge the gaps, how do I call that out with a defined explanation of what they're doing? Terms to describe this?

###### ChatGPT said:

### Quick vocabulary for calling out “knowledge-hoarding” behavior

| Term | What it means | How you might use it in a sentence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gatekeeping** | Controlling access to a field or group by withholding information or setting unnecessarily high entry barriers. | “I’m sensing some gatekeeping here—could we slow down and cover the basics so everyone can contribute?” |
| **Jargon-stacking** | Piling on insider terms without translation, making ideas harder (or impossible) for outsiders to follow. | “There’s a lot of jargon-stacking going on; can we translate that into plain language?” |
| **Curse of knowledge / expert blind spot** | The tendency for experts to forget what it’s like *not* to know something, so they skip critical context. | “I think we’re running into the curse of knowledge—can we rewind and define a few of those acronyms first?” |
| **Semantic intimidation** | Using abstruse language to signal superiority and discourage questions. | “That sounds like semantic intimidation rather than clarification—can we stick to concepts instead of labels for a minute?” |
| **Intellectual elitism (or snobbery)** | Behaving as if only people with certain credentials or vocabulary deserve to engage. | “Let’s avoid intellectual elitism—shared understanding matters more than showing off terminology.” |
| **Knowledge hoarding** | Treating information as power and refusing to share it freely. | “When information is hoarded, the team slows down. Could you walk us through the logic instead of just the buzzwords?” |
| **Obscurantism** | Deliberately making ideas opaque to maintain authority. | “This feels a bit like obscurantism. What problem are we actually solving beneath the terminology?” |

*(Use whichever label feels most accurate—sometimes simply naming the pattern breaks its spell.)*

### A constructive script for calling it out

1. **Name the pattern without attacking the person**
	> “I’m noticing a lot of specialized terms flying by that assume background knowledge some of us might not share.”
2. **State the impact**
	> “When that happens, the conversation stalls because people hesitate to ask ‘basic’ questions.”
3. **Request a change**
	> “Could we pause to define those acronyms or give a one-sentence summary before we dive deeper?”
4. **Offer cooperation, not blame**
	> “I’m happy to recap what I know or jot down a glossary as we go—would that help?”
5. **Redirect to shared goals**
	> “Our objective is X; clarity gets us there faster than specialized lingo.”

### Extra tools in your pocket

- **Meta-question**: “If a newcomer joined right now, would they follow this?”  
	Posing it to the group externalizes the issue; no one feels singled out.
- **Plain-language check**: “Could you explain that like you would to a smart intern?”  
	Invites simplification without implying the speaker is at fault.
- **Glossary creation**: Open a shared doc or whiteboard where terms get defined in real time.  
	You normalize clarification and remove the stigma of “not knowing.”
- **Escalation phrase** (when the impatience persists):
	> “I value your expertise, but the pace and terminology are excluding people who need to act on this. Let’s reset so the whole team can engage.”

Using these labels and moves lets you confront the *behavior*—gatekeeping, jargon-stacking, semantic intimidation—while preserving professional rapport and steering the discussion back to clarity.
