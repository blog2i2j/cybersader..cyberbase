**User:**

Can you schedule certain modes or volumes on iPhone so that your alarms always go off

---

**AI:**

Yes, you can configure your iPhone so that alarms always go off, regardless of volume or mode settings, by using **Focus Modes**, **Silent Mode settings**, and **Do Not Disturb (DND) exceptions**. Here's how:

### 1\. **Alarms Always Sound in Silent Mode**

- **iPhone alarms will always ring**, even if Silent Mode is enabled (the switch on the side of the phone).
- However, if your alarm volume is too low, it may not be audible.

### 2\. **Ensure Alarm Volume is Separate from Ringer**

- Go to **Settings > Sounds & Haptics**.
- Under **Ringtone and Alert Volume**, adjust the volume.
- **Disable "Change with Buttons"** to prevent accidental volume adjustments.

### 3\. **Focus Mode Scheduling (DND, Sleep, Work, etc.)**

- Go to **Settings > Focus**.
- Select **Do Not Disturb, Sleep, or any Focus mode**.
- Tap **Add Schedule** to set specific times or conditions (e.g., location, app use).
- Under **Allow Notifications**, make sure the **Clock app** is either allowed or alarms are excluded from the mute settings.

### 4\. **Bypass Silent and DND for Alarms**

- **Alarms set through the default Clock app will always ring**, but third-party alarm apps may need additional permissions.
- If using third-party alarm apps, go to **Settings > Focus > (your mode) > Apps** and allow that app to send notifications.

### 5\. **Use “Bedtime” for Reliable Alarms**

- Go to **Clock > Alarm > Sleep/Wake Up**.
- Set your **Wake Up Alarm** (this automatically ensures the alarm overrides Focus Modes).

### 6\. **Emergency Bypass for Critical Contacts**

- If you want certain contacts to bypass Focus or Silent Mode for calls, go to:
	- **Contacts > Select Contact > Edit > Ringtone** (or Text Tone).
	- Enable **Emergency Bypass**.

These settings ensure that your alarms always sound, even if your iPhone is on silent or following a scheduled Focus mode. Let me know if you need further customization!
