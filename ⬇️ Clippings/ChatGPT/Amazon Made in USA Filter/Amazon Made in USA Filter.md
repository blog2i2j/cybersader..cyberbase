##### You said:

is there an amazon filter for made in america?

###### ChatGPT said:

Short answer: **No—Amazon still doesn’t give shoppers a one-click “Made in USA” filter across the whole site.** Amazon only surfaces country-of-origin in the fine print of each product page, so you have to check listings one-by-one.

### What you *can* do instead

| Where to look | What it actually narrows | How to use it | Caveats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Keyword search** | Anything whose title or bullet text says “Made in USA/America” | Add the phrase to your search (e.g., *lifting straps made in USA*) and sort or filter by rating/Prime | Sellers sometimes stuff the keyword even when the product isn’t 100 % U.S-made—always open the detail page and read “Country of Origin.” |
| **Amazon Handmade ➜ “Location” filter** | Hand-crafted items where the artisan is based in the United States | From the left-hand filters choose *Handmade* → *Location* → *United States* | Only for Handmade listings; not all artisans’ raw materials are U.S-sourced. |
| **Small Business badge filter** | Products sold by U.S.-registered small businesses | After you run a search, expand *Business Type* on the left and tick *Small Business* | Good for supporting U.S. companies, but parts/materials can still be imported. |
| **Brand or Storefronts** | Sellers that explicitly specialize in U.S.-made goods (e.g., *Made In America Store*) | Click the seller name or search “Made in America Store” and hit *Visit the Storefront* | You’re confined to that seller’s catalog, but everything is 100 % U.S-manufactured. |
| **Third-party curation & browser add-ons** | External lists or extensions that flag U.S.-made listings | Sites like *MadeInUSAMatters.com* publish updated Amazon links; extensions such as Cultivate, Capital One Shopping, or Equo overlay origin info on Amazon pages | Reliability varies; still wise to double-check the listing details. |

#### Practical tips for faster vetting

1. **Combine filters** – Start with “made in usa” in the search box, then apply *Small Business* or *Prime* to trim obvious resellers.
2. **Read the bullet list** – Amazon requires the *Country of Origin* field on most categories (it’s usually near the bottom of the “Product Information” section).
3. **Watch for FTC language** – “Made in USA” can only be used legally if *all* significant parts and processing are American; anything less must say “Assembled in USA” or specify imported components.
4. **Bookmark good storefronts** – Once you find a brand that’s truly U.S-manufactured, save its Amazon Store URL so you can skip the hunt next time.

Until Amazon adds an official toggle (sellers have been lobbying for it, but nothing is on the roadmap yet), these work-arounds are your best bet.
