**User:**

WPA 2 PSK means pre-share key which means they don't use active directory Kerberos for correct?

**AI:**

​Yes, you're correct. WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 – Pre-Shared Key) utilizes a shared secret key for authenticating devices on a wireless network, without relying on Active Directory or Kerberos for authentication. In this mode, all devices use the same pre-shared key to connect, making it suitable for home or small office networks. ​

In contrast, WPA2-Enterprise employs 802.1X authentication, integrating with systems like Active Directory and utilizing protocols such as Kerberos. This setup allows each user to have unique credentials, enhancing security and control, which is particularly beneficial in larger or corporate environments. ​
