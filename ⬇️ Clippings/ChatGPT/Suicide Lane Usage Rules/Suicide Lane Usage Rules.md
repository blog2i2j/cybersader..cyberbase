title: Suicide Lane Usage Rules

##### You said:

Can you use a suicide lane as a place to get to if both lanes are really busy and you can only get across the first lane. In other words you pass the right going traffic get into the suicide lane and wait for an opening for the left going traffic?

###### ChatGPT said:

Generally speaking, you **cannot** use a two‑way left‑turn lane (often called a “suicide lane”) as a temporary refuge to wait for a gap in the opposite‑direction traffic. That center lane is reserved **only** for:

- **Preparing for or making a left turn** into a side street or driveway
- **Completing a U‑turn**, where explicitly allowed
- **Overtaking/passing** a slower vehicle in the same direction, and only if the lane is clear for a safe distance

In **Illinois law** (625 ILCS 5/11‑709(b)), it states:

> “Upon a roadway…divided into three lanes…a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane except when…in preparation for making a left turn or where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the same direction….”

Likewise, the **Illinois Rules of the Road** manual specifies:

> “A vehicle may not be driven in the two‑way left turn lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or when preparing for or making a U‑turn….”

### What to do instead

1. **Stay behind the through lanes**. If you can’t clear both lanes at once, remain in the right‑most through lane until you can safely cross.
2. **Use a signalized intersection**. Proceed to the next traffic light or roundabout where turning movements are controlled.
3. **Plan your turn**. If traffic is consistently heavy, consider an alternate route with safer turn opportunities.

> - It’s **dangerous**, exposing you to head‑on conflicts and blocking other motorists’ legal turn movements.

Always check the specific rules in your state or municipality, but in Chicago (and across Illinois), using the center turn lane as a “waiting lane” to cross multi‑lane traffic is both unsafe and violates the vehicle code.

Okay but you can take a right turn left turn into some spot or turn around and then take a right turn

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes—so long as **each individual turn** you make is itself legal, you can avoid crossing two busy through‑lanes by stringing together a right, a turnaround (or “box”) maneuver, then another right. But beware:

1. **Right‑turn onto a side street or driveway**
	- You must signal and yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic.
	- If you turn into private property (a parking lot or driveway), you need the owner’s permission—otherwise it’s trespassing.
2. **Perform a lawful U‑turn or three‑point turn**
	- Some streets prohibit U‑turns by signage—look for a “No U‑Turn” sign.
	- If there’s a designated median crossover (sometimes called a “Michigan left” or “jughandle”), you may use that instead.
3. **Right‑turn onto your original roadway**
	- Again, signal and yield.
	- Don’t block driveways, sidewalks, or oncoming traffic as you re‑enter.

### Why you might do this

- **Safety**: You’re making two simpler turns rather than trying to dash across two lanes at once.
- **Legality**: You’re only ever in the center turn lane to actually turn, not to “park” or wait .

---

### What **not** to do

- Don’t use the two‑way left‑turn (suicide) lane as a “waiting room.” That lane’s only legal uses are:
	1. Preparing for/making a left turn
	2. Completing a U‑turn where allowed
	3. Overtaking a vehicle in the same direction, if it’s safe .
- Never block traffic while you figure out your next turn.

---

**Bottom line:**  
A well‑executed “right–turn, U‑turn (or box turn), right” is perfectly legal—just treat each as its own turn, obey the signs, yield appropriately, and stay out of the suicide lane except to turn.

##### You said:

I'm guessing this isn't allowed for the suicide lane because most people don't use their turn signals early enough

###### ChatGPT said:

Not quite – it isn’t the turn‑signal timing that makes using the two‑way left‑turn (suicide) lane as a “waiting” lane illegal. The Illinois Vehicle Code simply bars you from driving in that center lane except to:

1. **Prepare for or make a left turn**
2. **Prepare for or make a U‑turn** (where allowed by law)

Regardless of how—or when—you use your signal, entering that lane to “sit” before darting across both through‑lanes violates **625 ILCS 5/11‑709(b)(2)**.

Separately, Illinois does require you to signal your intention to turn or change lanes for **at least 100 feet** in a business or residence district (200 feet outside such districts) . Failing to signal properly is its own moving violation—but it doesn’t somehow authorize you to use a lane that the code restricts to turning movements only.

##### You said:

Yes but that's the essence despite with the law says. Think more fundamentally come on

###### ChatGPT said:

Think of that center “suicide” lane not as a parking spot or refuge, but as a high‑risk mixing zone where cars swinging left from both directions decelerate and accelerate. If you treat it like a waiting lane, you:

- **Break everyone’s mental model.**  
	Drivers approaching it expect vehicles to slow briefly through, then clear. A stationary car there isn’t in their mental map—so they’re startled, may brake suddenly or veer around you.
- **Create hidden conflict points.**  
	The lane is used by traffic from both sides. If you stop in it, oncoming left‑turners can’t see you until the last moment—and they assume it’s clear for them to merge. That’s a recipe for head‑on or sideswipe crashes.
- **Lose the buffer that a proper turn pocket gives.**  
	Real left‑turn lanes are long enough for one car to clear the through lanes, then weave back safely. When you fill it and wait, there’s no space to maneuver, and you may block others who legitimately need it for their turn.
- **Undermine safe sight distance.**  
	Engineers design that lane so drivers can see a quick gap, turn, and clear. Stopping there reduces the clear sight triangle—both for you deciding when to pull out and for others spotting your move.
- **Mix speeds and intentions.**  
	You’re stopped, through‑traffic is whizzing past on both sides, and turn‑traffic is still looking for a gap. You’ve essentially created a little island of confusion mid‑block.

Fundamentally, the center lane is a transient deceleration/acceleration buffer—not a lay‑by. Using it as “Plan B” shatters the predictable flow and puts everybody at risk.

If you need to avoid crossing two lanes at once, the safer, predictable patterns are:

1. **Right–turn plus U‑turn (or three‑point) at a designated crossover.**
2. **Use the next signalized intersection or jughandle.**
3. **Plan your route to avoid heavy mid‑block crossings.**

Those options keep every driver’s expectations aligned and preserve the safety function of that middle lane.
