**AI:**

​Ali Sayed of Optimum Tech transitioned his racing simulator setup to incorporate virtual reality, opting for the Bigscreen Beyond headset. This ultra-lightweight device, weighing just 127 grams, is significantly lighter than other VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3 or Valve Index, which weigh between 500–800 grams. The reduced weight and compact design help minimize neck strain and inertia during extended racing sessions, enhancing overall comfort.​

The Bigscreen Beyond features high-resolution microOLED displays at 2560×2560 per eye, providing exceptional clarity. This level of detail allows for easy reading of in-game gauges and text, which is crucial for sim racing. Additionally, its OLED technology offers a contrast ratio of 500,000:1, delivering deep blacks and vivid colors, particularly beneficial for night racing scenarios.​

Ali shared his experience, stating that the Bigscreen Beyond's form factor is "5 years ahead of everything else" and that it offers "one of the best PC gaming experiences" available. He was so impressed that he replaced his multi-thousand dollar triple-monitor setup with this VR solution, noting that it "completely just blew them out of the park." ​
