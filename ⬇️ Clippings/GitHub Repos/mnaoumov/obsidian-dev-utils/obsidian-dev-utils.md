## README

`Obsidian Dev Utils` is a collection of essential functions and CLI tools designed to streamline your Obsidian plugin development process. Whether you're building a plugin from scratch or enhancing an existing one, these utilities are here to simplify your workflow.

## What is Obsidian?[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It's a tool that lets you take notes and organize them, and it supports a rich plugin ecosystem that allows for extensive customization.

## Who Should Use This Package?This package is ideal for developers who are building or maintaining plugins for Obsidian. It provides a range of tools to make the development process easier, including automated builds, linting, spellchecking, and more.

## Plugin GeneratorThere is a [Obsidian Plugin Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/mnaoumov/generator-obsidian-plugin) that sets up a new Obsidian plugin project with a basic structure and some useful scripts from this library.

## InstallationTo install the package, run the following command:

npm install obsidian-dev-utils
