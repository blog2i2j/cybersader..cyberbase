# Features- **Standalone client**
	Legcord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way.
- **Various mods built-in**
	Enjoy [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord), [Shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter) and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice!
- **Themes**
	Legcord natively supports theming of the entire app, you can easily import BetterDiscord themes and manage them
- **Made for Privacy™**
	Legcord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods, you can feel safe and secure!
- **Supports Rich Presence**
	Unlike other clients, Legcord supports rich presence (game activity) out of the box thanks to [arRPC](https://arrpc.openasar.dev/).
- **Mobile support**
	Legcord has **experimental** mobile support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from an ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it.
- **Much more stable**
	Legcord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.
- **Cross-platform support!**
	Legcord was originally created for AArch64 Linux devices since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that [Electron supports](https://github.com/electron/electron#platform-support)!

Unlike many others, we provide seamless integration for loading themes and mods without the need for installers or injectors. You can easily enable transparency effects and adopt Windows' Fluent Design, offering a modern and sleek interface. Though it's fundamentally a web wrapper, we have implemented numerous optimizations and patches to ensure a smooth and tailored experience for you.
