> [!NOTE]
> 🚀 PRs are very welcome

## What is this list?Once your fingers have [learned](https://www.thejach.com/view/2012/07/vims_learning_curve_is_wrong) to speak Vim, they don't want to speak anything else! It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text. Thus, it's natural that one would like to get Vim-like keybindings in as many programs we use as possible.

The intention of this collaborative list is to:

- learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings. Search in your browser with `ctrl/cmd + f`.
- discover new programs that support Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindings?
- be up-to-date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve!

There are of course already lists like this one floating around on the internet (see [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/erikw/#Acknowledgments)). While they are great, the issue is that they are not up-to-date with the latest developments. There are Vim-emulator add-ons being developed all the time! This is why this collaborative list was created.

(yes, technically it is **vi**\-like keybindings we talk about here, but most people know and Google for vim, thus vim is used here instead of vi).

> [!TIP]
> Tip: navigate this document easily by using GitHub's built-in Markdown Table of Contents in the top left corner:

## LegendThe following symbols and formattings are used with each list item to make it clearer what kind of Vim keybindings support exist:

- ✅ - built-in support (possibly via a setting)
- ➕ - via addon/extension
- ~~strikethrough~~: deprecated or unsupported software

Terminology:

- [TUI](https://itlaw.fandom.com/wiki/Text_user_interface) - Text User Interface

# The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List## Debuggers- ✅ [cgdb](http://cgdb.github.io/) - a curses interface on top of the GDB debuger with keybindings modeled after vim.
- ✅ [vimpdb](https://github.com/gotcha/vimpdb) - An integration of the python debugger `pdb` and vim.

## Development- ✅ [ipython](https://ipython.org/) - Interactive Python shell. It no longer uses readline for input, so it must be configured in the ipython profile `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` itself ([reference](https://gist.github.com/sstirlin/c3c207b1052b613ab9554b4ebdfc3f35)):
	- c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editing\_mode = "vi"
- ✅ [GHCi](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/GHCi) - Interactive Haskell environment. It uses [haskeline](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskeline) instead of readline. Put this in `~/.haskeline`:
	- editMode: Vi
- ➕ [Jupyter Lab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-vim/) - Science and Data Development notebook environment.

	- ➕ [Vim plugin](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) - Cannot be installed directly in the plugin section. Go to [Vim plugin release page](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/releases) and download `.vsix` file. Inside Azure Data Studio navigate to Extensions > three dots at the top > Install from VSXI. You will likely see message: "Unable to install extension 'vscodevim.vim' as it is not compatible with the current VS Code engine version". If you see that message you should try earlier release.
- ✅ [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Data analysis and machine learning tool that allows you to combine executable Python code and rich text along with charts, images, HTML, LaTeX and more into a single document stored in Google Drive.

## Source Code Management- ✅ [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Nothing's better than the real deal. Tell git to use vim/nvim when editing commit messages, interactive rebase etc. by putting in your `~/.config/git/config`:
	- \[user\]
		    editor = vim
- ✅ [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - Text interface for git. Works mostly like vim out of the box, but can be enhanced by sourcing these [keybindings](https://github.com/jonas/tig/blob/master/contrib/vim.tigrc) in your `~/.tigrc`.

	- instruction how to enable vi bindings - [https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui/blob/master/KEY\_CONFIG.md](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui/blob/master/KEY_CONFIG.md)

## Shells- ✅ [readline](https://man.archlinux.org/man/readline.3) - Readline is a library used by many CLI programs to read input from users. By configuring readline to use vi key bindings, you automatically get it for programs like `bash`, `irb`, `octave` etc. By default, readline has Emacs-like keybindings, but you can change that by putting this in your `~/.inputrc`:
	- ```
		set editing-mode vi
		set keymap vi-insert
		```
- ✅ [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - The preferred method is to set Vi mode in `~/.inputrc` via readline, as you will get Vi mode automatically in all programs using the library. However, if you just want this for bash, put this in your bash startup file e.g. `~/.bashrc`:
	- set -o vi
	- ➕ [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh) (Bash Line Editor) - An interactive plugin `ble.sh` provides a better Vim mode as well as syntax highlighting and autosuggestions. In addition to the above setting of `set -o vi` in `~/.bashrc` or `set editing-mode vi` in `~/.inputrc`, you can add the following settings in `~/.bashrc` to enable `ble.sh`.
		- ```
			# bashrc
			# Add this lines at the top of .bashrc:
			[[ $- == *i* ]] && source /path/to/blesh/ble.sh --noattach
			# your bashrc settings come here...
			# Add this line at the end of .bashrc:
			[[ ! ${BLE_VERSION-} ]] || ble-attach
			```
- ✅ [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) - just put this in your ZSH startup file, most likely `~/.zshrc`:
	- bindkey -v
	- Extra text object keybindings
		# Add text object extension -- eg ci" da(:
		autoload -U select-quoted
		zle -N select-quoted
		for m in visual viopp; do
		    for c in {a,i}{\\',\\",\\\`}; do
		        bindkey -M $m $c select-quoted
		    done
		done
	- ➕ [zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode) - A better and friendly Vim-mode plugin for zsh.
- ✅ [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - Just add to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28445450/265508)):
	- fish\_vi\_key\_bindings
- ✅ [tcsh](https://www.tcsh.org/) - Put this in your tcsh startup file e.g. `~/.tcshrc` ([reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mac-os-x/0596004583/ch04s02.html)):
	- bindkey -v
- ✅ [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) - Put this in your ksh startup file e.g. `~/.kshrc`:
	- set -o vi
- ✅ [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) - Put this in your config file e.g. `$nu.config-path`:
	- let\-env config \= {
		  # ...
		  edit\_mode: vi,
		  # ...
		}
- ✅ [pwsh](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) - The Readline module offers support for convenient vim support. Add this to your `$Profile`: \*
	```
	Import-Module PSReadLine
	 # enable Vim on the shell and as editor
	 $OnViModeChange = [scriptblock]{
	    if ($args[0] -eq 'Command') {
	        # Set the cursor to a blinking block.
	        Write-Host -NoNewLine "\`e[2 q"
	    }
	    else {
	        # Set the cursor to a blinking line.
	        Write-Host -NoNewLine "\`e[5 q"
	    }
	 }
	 Set-PsReadLineOption -EditMode Vi
	 Set-PSReadLineOption -ViModeIndicator Script -ViModeChangeHandler $OnViModeChange
	```
	- This was collected from many github issues and posts. Powershell 5.1 for one reason or another refuses to change the cursor so the script to give feedback does not work. Just remove it and it will still work, just no feedback of the mode you're in.
- ✅ [xsh](https://xon.sh/) - Put this in your run control file `~/.xonshrc`:
	- ```
		$VI_MODE = True
		```
