## Summary

The video '2025: The Dawn of Energy Abundance | TOO CHEAP TO METER Film' suggests that new technologies will make energy cheaper, abundant, and potentially unlimited. This could be achieved through fusion power, advanced nuclear reactors, or innovative ways of harnessing solar energy. The film is part of the S3 channel.

## Description

In 1954, Atomic Energy Chairman Lewis Strauss promised energy "too cheap to meter." In 2025, we interviewed 15 pioneers working to shape the future of energy. Our second frontier film is out now: 'TOO CHEAP TO METER' — their vision may finally deliver on that promise.

This film was sponsored by the Abundance Institute: https://youtu.be/61NIN5a24SM
