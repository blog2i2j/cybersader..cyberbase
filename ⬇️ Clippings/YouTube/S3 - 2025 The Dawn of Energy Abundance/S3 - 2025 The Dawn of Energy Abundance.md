## Summary

The video discusses the future of energy abundance and features interviews with 15 pioneers working on nuclear and fusion technologies to achieve Lewis Strauss' 1954 vision of 'too cheap to meter' energy solutions.

## Description

In 1954, Atomic Energy Chairman Lewis Strauss promised energy "too cheap to meter." In 2025, we interviewed 15 pioneers working to shape the future of energy. Our second frontier film is out now: 'TOO CHEAP TO METER' — their vision may finally deliver on that promise.
