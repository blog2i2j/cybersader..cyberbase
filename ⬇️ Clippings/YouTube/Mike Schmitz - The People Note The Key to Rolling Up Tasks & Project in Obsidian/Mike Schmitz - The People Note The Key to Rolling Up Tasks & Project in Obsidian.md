## Summary

Mike Schmitz introduces the People Note system, a method for rolling up collaborative tasks and projects within Obsidian. It utilizes Obsidian Tasks queries, tags (including 'The People Tag'), and macros to manage workflow. The system addresses urgency and helps prevent tasks from falling through the cracks. The template and related plugins (Obsidian Tasks, QuickAdd, Templater, Callout Manager, Dataview) are available for free at practicalpkm.com/vault.

## Description

The People Note is how I overcame the traditional limitations of collaborative task and project management in Obsidian. In this video, I'll show you how I use it to roll up tasks, projects, and meeting notes into a single place so nothing falls through the cracks.
