St. Paul Center is a Catholic organization providing resources and education. 

Since 2001, the St. Paul Center has been empowering Catholics around the world to encounter the incarnate Word in God's inspired Word.

The St. Paul Center is a nonprofit research and educational institute that promotes life-transforming Scripture study from the heart of the Church. We want to raise up a new generation of priests who are fluent in the Bible and lay people who are biblically literate. For us, this means equipping them to enter into the heart of the living Word of God and to be transformed and renewed by this encounter.

### Founding of the St. Paul Center

Dr. Scott Hahn, Kimberly Hahn, and Mike Aquilina found the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology in Steubenville, Ohio.

### Get in Touch

The St. Paul Center is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, ET. Our headquarters in Steubenville, Ohio welcomes visitors to explore our resources, take part in conferences, and participate in biblical studies.
