**Self-Hosted LiveSync by vortamoroz**

This community-developed Obsidian plugin provides a secure, self-hosted synchronization solution utilizing CouchDB or Object Storage (e.g., MinIO, S3, R2) for efficient and private note synchronization. Key features include automatic conflict resolution, end-to-end encryption, customization sync (including settings, snippets, themes, and plugins), and hidden file synchronization.  The plugin supports WebRTC peer-to-peer synchronization (experimental) and offers a status bar with detailed synchronization activity indicators.  It’s designed for researchers, engineers, and developers prioritizing data security and control.  Important considerations include backing up vaults before installation, avoiding simultaneous use with other synchronization solutions, and recognizing that it’s a synchronization tool, not a backup solution.  Setup options include a 3-minute CouchDB on fly.io configuration or manual setup using CouchDB on fly.io or IBM Cloudant.  The plugin’s status bar provides real-time synchronization activity monitoring.
