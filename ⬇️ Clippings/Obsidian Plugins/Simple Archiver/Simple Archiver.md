title: "Simple Archiver - An Obsidian plugin that enables you to quickly archive a single note or an entire folder of notes."
aliases:
description: "The Simple Archiver plugin streamlines the process of organizing your Obsidian vault by moving files or entire folders into a designated archive directory. It retains the original folder structure by placing items in a mirrored relative path inside the archive. This helps declutter your active workspace while preserving context and organization for archived content. Users can initiate archiving through a command or a convenient file menu option. The plugin automatically creates the archive folder if it doesn't already exist, simplifying setup."
