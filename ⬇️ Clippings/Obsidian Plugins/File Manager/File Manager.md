## Overview

## Key Features
*   **Dynamic Views:** Generate tables and lists that automatically update as your notes change.
*   **Query Language:** Utilizes a flexible query language to filter and sort notes based on various criteria.
*   **Metadata Support:** Leverages Obsidian's metadata system (e.g., tags, dates, properties) for powerful filtering.
*   **Customizable Templates:** Create custom templates to control the appearance and structure of your views.
*   **Integration with Obsidian:** Seamlessly integrates with Obsidian's core functionality.
*   **Community Support:** A vibrant community provides support, plugins, and examples.

## Technical Details
Dataview is built using JavaScript and relies on Obsidian's API. It's designed to be efficient and performant, even with large vaults. The query language is based on JavaScript syntax, offering a robust and expressive way to define your views.
