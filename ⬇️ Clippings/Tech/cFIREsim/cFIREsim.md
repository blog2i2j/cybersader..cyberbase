# cFIREsim Overview

## What is cFIREsim?

cFIREsim stands for Crowdsourced Financial Independence and Retire Early Simulator. It addresses the question: "If the market does no worse than the great depression, 1970's stagflation, or the dotcom bust, will my money last in retirement?"

## What's New with cFIREsim 3.0?

*   Made the site https-only for more secure data.
*   Site is now automatically updating it's data from Robert Schiller's website, without my intervention.
*   While there is currently no log-in feature, each simulation will give a link on the output page that will allow you to return to it.
*   Previous versions of cFIREsim (and of other calculators like FireCalc) have rounded calculations, every step of the way, to 2 digits. On par with most other financial calculations, I'm now keeping 10+ digits of precision, until I display a value to you.
*   The look/feel of the Statistics page is different.
