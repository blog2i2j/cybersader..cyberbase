# WenFire FIRE Calculator Summary

This page introduces the WenFire FIRE Calculator, a tool designed to help users visualize their path to financial independence and early retirement (FIRE). The calculator utilizes key assumptions to project financial outcomes. 

## Key Assumptions and Limitations

The calculator relies on several assumptions that users should understand:

*   **Investment Growth:** Assumes a fixed annual investment growth rate of approximately 7%, acknowledging that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns.
*   **Inflation:** Incorporates a constant inflation rate, recognizing that actual inflation rates fluctuate over time.
*   **Salary Increases:** Assumes consistent annual salary increases, recognizing potential variations in income growth.
*   **Spending:** Assumes constant monthly spending, adjusted for inflation, acknowledging potential lifestyle changes.
*   **Safe Withdrawal Rate:** Utilizes the 4% rule for determining sustainable withdrawal rates, acknowledging its historical basis and potential need for adjustments.

## Calculator Overview

The calculator provides a framework for projecting financial independence by considering investment growth, inflation, salary increases, spending, and the safe withdrawal rate. It’s intended as a tool for initial planning and exploration, emphasizing the importance of regular review and adaptation to individual circumstances and market conditions.
