# SimpleFIN Overview

SimpleFIN (SFIN) is a protocol for simple financial aggregation, described as "RSS for financial information." It enables read-only financial interchange, functioning like a "window on a safe," allowing users to view financial data without granting access to modify it. Users retain control over who can view their data.

## Key Benefits of SimpleFIN

*   **Easy Comprehension:** The protocol specification can be understood within a single day.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Banks do not need to pay for usage, unlike QFX.
*   **Promotes Security Awareness:** Ubiquitous use will educate users against sharing account credentials.
