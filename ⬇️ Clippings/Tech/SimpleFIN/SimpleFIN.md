# SimpleFIN Overview

SimpleFIN (SFIN) is a protocol for simple financial aggregation, designed to provide read-only access to financial information.

## Key Features and Benefits

*   **Read-Only Access:** All access is strictly read-only, preventing any modification of user data.
*   **Transparent Specification:** The protocol specification can be understood within a single day.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Banks do not need to pay for usage, unlike systems like QFX.
*   **Education:** Promotes awareness against sharing account credentials.

## SimpleFIN Concept

SimpleFIN operates like a "window on a safe," allowing users to view their financial data without granting access to modify it. It’s likened to RSS for financial information.
