Snowflake Access Management - Titan

Titan is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that helps users and organizations manage Snowflake resources like users, roles, warehouses, and integrations. It allows for declarative Python or YAML-based configuration of Snowflake resources, including warehouses, grants, and integrations. The tool provides a way to define and apply configurations, such as setting up a warehouse with a specific size and suspend time, and granting permissions to a specific role within the warehouse. The Titan Core tool is designed to replace traditional infrastructure management tools, enabling developers to manage Snowflake resources efficiently.
