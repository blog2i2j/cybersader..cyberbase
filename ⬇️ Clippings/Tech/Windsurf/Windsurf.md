{{"summarize this page's content in a clean markdown format with no intros.  Needs to read professionally and not like AI wrote it or answered a question.  As if summarizing for purposes of indexing it. Be thorough and structure the summary. Put newlines before and after headings. If the content is empty, then leave that out and just use the description. Don't include images.  Communicate all of the content in an efficient and not-too-concise manner.  Include markdown headings to break things down."}}
