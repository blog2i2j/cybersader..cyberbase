Windsurf Editor is an AI-powered IDE, formerly Codeium, designed to keep developers in a flow state. It's the first agentic IDE, offering a coding experience that combines AI collaboration (Copilot) and independent task execution (Agent). Key features include seamless integration with Windsurf extensions, unmatched performance, and a user experience focused on flow. The editor is built to synchronize with the developer's state, creating a 'mind-meld' experience. It leverages 'Flows' – agents and copilots working together in sync. The editor offers download options and documentation.
