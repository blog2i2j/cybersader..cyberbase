Raycast is a productivity tool launcher offering a collection of powerful tools within a single interface. It’s designed for speed, ergonomics, and reliability. Key features include an extendable launcher, AI extensions, team collaboration, developer tools, and a changelog. Users can log in, download for Mac (v1.94.0, macOS 12+ via Homebrew), and join the Windows waitlist. The app offers a search function and supports various file types (text, images, files, links, colors). It’s available for pricing, user login, and developer resources. The app’s core features include AI extensions and a focus on shortcuts rather than detours. The app is designed to be efficient and user-friendly.
