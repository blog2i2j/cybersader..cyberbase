# EasyOptOuts: Data Removal Service

EasyOptOuts is a service designed to help individuals remove their personal information from people-search websites and data broker sites. The company was founded by childhood friends, Ben and Tyler, who experienced firsthand the extent of their personal data's visibility online.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Your Data:** Users complete a sign-up form, providing minimal information – name, birth year, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and relatives. Sensitive information like IDs or SSNs are not required.
2. **Scan and Opt Out:** EasyOptOuts searches for the user's data across a network of over 160 supported sites, including BeenVerified, MyLife, PeopleFinders, Radaris, Spokeo, and WhitePages.  The system automatically opts the user out of each location where their data is found.
3. **Reports:** After the opt-out process, users receive an email report detailing the websites from which their data was removed.

## Key Features and Benefits

*   **Affordable Pricing:**  A yearly subscription costs $19.99, significantly less than competing services.
*   **Independent Operation:**  EasyOptOuts operates without ties to data brokers or investors, ensuring unbiased service.
*   **Thorough Search:** The system utilizes a comprehensive search strategy, considering all name and address combinations to maximize opt-out effectiveness.
*   **Privacy Focused:** The company minimizes data requests and guarantees no data sharing beyond the opt-out process.
