## User Testimonial

"Bye Postman, hello Bruno. I say goodbye to Postman for API pentesting, it has become a very heavy and annoying API client, now it forces you to be connected, log in and use their cloud services to use Collection Runner, launch tests among other options. Bruno is light, fast, you can work offline and to work collaboratively you are not forced to do it using the Postman cloud, it is possible to do it with Bru files and a traditional version control like git. I am not being paid to say this, I just think it is a very valid alternative."
