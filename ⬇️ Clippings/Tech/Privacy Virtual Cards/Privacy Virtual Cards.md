# Privacy Virtual Cards Summary

This page details Privacy Virtual Cards, a solution designed to protect users' financial information during online transactions.

## Overview

Virtual cards are automatically generated 16-digit card numbers that can be generated instantly. They provide a secure way to mask personal and financial details when making online purchases.

## What is a Virtual Card?

A virtual card, also known as a temporary card number or anonymous card number, is a credit or debit card number created through a website or mobile app. Unlike traditional physical cards, virtual cards do not have a physical component. Key features include the ability to set maximum spend limits and, in some cases, restrict usage to specific merchants to mitigate risk from potential breaches.

## How Do Virtual Cards Work?

Virtual cards function similarly to traditional credit or debit cards but without the physical card. They are unique, 16-digit payment card numbers with a CVV and expiration date. They can be used for online shopping, over-the-phone purchases, or any transaction requiring a card number.  The technology aims to address the limitations of previous virtual card offerings, providing a simple and convenient solution for enhanced security.
