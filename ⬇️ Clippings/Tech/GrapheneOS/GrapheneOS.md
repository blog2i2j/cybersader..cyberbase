# GrapheneOS: A Secure and Private Mobile Operating System

## Overview

GrapheneOS is a privacy and security-focused mobile operating system designed for Android app compatibility. Developed as a non-profit open-source project, it prioritizes research and development in privacy and security technologies. Key areas of focus include enhanced sandboxing, exploit mitigations, and improvements to the Android permission model.

## Key Features and Improvements

*   **Bottom-Up Security:** GrapheneOS implements security measures from the core of the OS, aiming to mitigate entire classes of vulnerabilities and significantly increase the difficulty of exploiting common vulnerabilities.
*   **App Sandboxing:** Fortifies app sandboxes and other security boundaries to isolate applications and limit their access to system resources.
*   **Permission Management:** Provides granular control over app permissions, including toggles for features like Network, Sensors, and restrictions when the device is locked (USB-C/pogo pins, camera, quick tiles).
*   **Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contributions:**  GrapheneOS contributes substantial privacy and security improvements to the AOSP, addressing vulnerabilities and enhancing overall system security.
*   **Non-Profit Development:**  Operated as a non-profit, ensuring a focus on long-term sustainability and community-driven development.

## Historical Context

*   **Formerly CopperheadOS:** GrapheneOS evolved from CopperheadOS, demonstrating a continuous commitment to privacy and security innovation.
