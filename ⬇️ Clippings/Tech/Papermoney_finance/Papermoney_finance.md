# PaperMoney Personal Finance App Summary

PaperMoney is a personal finance application that utilizes double-entry accounting to provide a comprehensive view of a user's financial situation. It enables users to track expenses, net worth, shared finances, and investments with accuracy. The core functionality centers around managing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, ensuring correct calculations for net worth and cash flow.

## Key Features

*   **Double-Entry Accounting:**  The application employs double-entry accounting principles, which is crucial for accurate financial tracking and reporting. This means every transaction is recorded with at least two entries – one debit and one credit – to maintain balance.
*   **Net Worth Tracking:**  PaperMoney accurately calculates and tracks net worth by considering assets, liabilities, income, and expenses.
*   **Cash Flow Management:**  Users can monitor their cash flow by analyzing income and expenses.
*   **Shared Finances:**  Supports tracking finances with partners or family members.
*   **Investment Tracking:**  Allows users to track investments alongside other financial data.

## Core Concepts

The application emphasizes the importance of correctly categorizing income and expenses.  Specifically, it highlights that income should not be reduced to account for taxes, and expenses should be recorded accurately to avoid misrepresenting the account balance. The system is designed to prevent common errors in personal finance tracking.

## Example Scenario

A typical scenario involves receiving a salary of $1000, with $300 allocated to taxes. PaperMoney correctly records this as income ($1000) and a liability ($300) for taxes, ensuring the net worth calculation is accurate. The application prevents users from incorrectly reducing income or adding taxes as expenses, maintaining the integrity of the financial data.
