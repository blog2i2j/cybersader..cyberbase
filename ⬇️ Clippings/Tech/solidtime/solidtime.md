# solidtime - The Modern Open Source Timetracker

Solidtime is a modern, open-source time tracker designed for freelancers and agencies. It allows users to manage projects, tasks, clients, and billing in a centralized system.

## For Freelancers and Teams

Solidtime facilitates collaboration with teams through a Roles and Permission System, offering granular control. It can also be used independently by individual freelancers.

## Book a Demo

Potential users can schedule a 30-minute demo to assess if Solidtime is a suitable fit for their company.

## Join our Community

The Solidtime community can be accessed through Discord, where users receive updates, ask questions, and share feedback.

## Time-Tracking at your fingertips

The global command menu provides access to all available actions within the time tracker.

## Progressive Mobile Experience

Solidtime leverages Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) to deliver a fast and consistent experience across iOS, Android, and other mobile OS platforms. Features include native system notifications and offline tracking (coming soon).

## Quick & Easy Migration

Solidtime supports data import from other time tracking applications like Toggl and Clockify, simplifying the transition process.
