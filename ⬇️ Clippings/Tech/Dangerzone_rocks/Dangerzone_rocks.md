# Dangerzone - Secure Document Conversion

Dangerzone is a free and open-source project developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) designed to safely convert potentially dangerous documents, such as PDFs, office documents, and images, into secure PDFs. It achieves this through a process of rendering the document into pixels within a secure sandbox and reconstructing it locally as a PDF, effectively removing malware.

**Key Features:**

*   **Malware Removal:** Destroys malware by rendering documents into pixels in a secure sandbox.
*   **File Type Support:** Supports over 20 file types, including PDFs, Microsoft Office formats, and common image types.
*   **Network Isolation:** Documents are sanitized in a sandbox with no network access, preventing potential compromise.
*   **Open Source & Nonprofit:**  Maintained by FPF, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting and defending press freedom.
