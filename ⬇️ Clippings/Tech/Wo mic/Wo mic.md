# WO Mic - Free Microphone Overview

This page details the WO Mic, a free software solution that transforms a mobile phone into a microphone for computer use. The system utilizes a three-component architecture:

*   **WO Mic App:** Runs on the phone, capturing voice and transmitting it to the computer.
*   **WO Mic Client:** Runs on the computer, connecting to the app, receiving voice data, and passing it to a virtual microphone device.
*   **WO Mic Virtual Device:** Runs in kernel space on the computer, simulating a real microphone device and providing audio data to applications like Sound Recorder.

The WO Mic supports various connection methods including USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi Direct. Key features include a wireless microphone without cost, compatibility with any PC program, minimal latency, ease of configuration, auto-reconnection upon PC reboot, and audio format specifications (48000 sampling rate, 16 bits per sample, mono channel).

It's designed for talking, recording, voice remote control, and other audio-related activities. The system's architecture facilitates seamless integration with existing audio applications on the computer.
