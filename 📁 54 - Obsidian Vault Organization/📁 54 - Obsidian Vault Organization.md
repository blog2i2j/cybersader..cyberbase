# Organizational Components by Importance

- Tags
	- Nested tags
		- Allows you to have overlapping ontologies, rather than the strict structure you get with folders
- Links
	- Links are a great way to relate specific parts of ontologies
- Folders
	- "Storefront" for your general audience and self.  
	- This is what will be seen by the storage for your vault (e.g. GitHub repo or file explorer), so it should allow people to navigate your vault relatively easily
	- You are still ultimately limited by this since you need a folder structure to do anything
