# Problems in Tagging

- folders to tagging
    - format to snake case for folder path and make a nested tag - [Dynamic Tags from Folder](../Dynamic%20Tags%20Based%20on%20Folder/Dynamic%20Tags%20from%20Folder.md)
- where do untagged go?
- how do we move to certain types of folders based on parent tags with nested tags (untagged go to unstructured section)?
- How do folder notes affect this?
- Most tag related plugin will just use regular tags and not allow appending things for structuring
- What's the actual alphabetic order in this?
