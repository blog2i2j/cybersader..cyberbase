# Components of Organization

> [!summary] These are ways to mentally model how and why to organize information

## Goals of Organization

1) Information Retrieval
	- Finding the thing that you need for whatever it is
2) Knowledge Work
	- Working with information from within the system itself (libraries aren't made for this)
3) Action
	- The goals of some organizational systems (like planners or todo lists) are for helping towards actions or goals
4) Knowledge Capture or Inputs
	- Some systems just need to be easy to put stuff into boxes

## Things we can organize by?

- STIR
	- **S**pace
	- **T**ime
	- **I**mportance
	- **R**elatedness
- LATCH
	- **L**ocation
	- **A**lphabet
	- **T**ime
	- **C**ategory
	- **H**ierarchy (the original refers to this as “Continuum”, but that’s not as catchy)
- Ways to organize
	- By the process (input, organizing, output)
	- By the content (ontologies, clustering/keywords)
	- By actionability
	- By the time (modified or created or published)
	- By name (alphabet, naming schemes)
