# My ideas for systems

## Contributable knowledge hub that doubles for PKM (the hybrid system) - a system for knowledge output, communication, integration, and compatibility 

this is the hardest system to figure out.  I've tried thinking of the best way to do it, so here's my take

- this system should let you rapidly do knowledge capture and knowledge work building your second brain.  however, the goal here is to also have a "storefront" or organized library for consumption for some audience or even just for other information systems.  for instance this can help if you have 
- the reason for a library is to enable information retrieval for certain folks (hence the term "folksonomies").  This could be your family, yourself, an audience or community online, or whomever.  you could even have different libraries/storefronts/organized information interfaces for working in file explorer and more. this is where organizing by content and not by process becomes helpful.  any structured information organization system is a component you can use within this but we also have the other systems for knowledge work and capture.  the point of this system is to enable both to work in harmony.

### folder structure example 1

this applies to:
- windows OS
- English file order or collation (helps with alphabetical order)
- knowledge work
- audience or system consumption / retrieval / output / library / taxonomy / knowledge dissemination / communication / publication

> there are three labels I will use: KO (knowledge output to some entity, system, or audience), KC (knowledge capture from some entity, system, process, etc.), and KW (knowledge work, organization, etc.)

maybe add a fourth for relating or meta organization?  in terms of purposes for things in the vault.  this could also be called system/meta/organizing/relating

these are the three purposes you can apply to a top level folder (still deciding on if this applies to lower levels and if they can differ as you go down). MAYBE you can add but can't take away as you go down.

The COW approach (capture, output, work/purpose/action) or some other term we will find for a good acronym

maybe COWS? - CAPTURE OUTPUT WORK (+SYSTEM)
maybe WORCS - work,output,relate,capture,system

This is essentially the same basic process of ARC from Nick Milo (add, relate, communicate) but definitely slightly different.  work doesn't have to be relating things.

MojiDex - use emojis to sort these (emojis are essentially numbers)

C/A - capture or add - these can be organized to a degree but you should avoid organizing in this space with folders except by going down one level.  limit organizing down to one additional folder level
W/R - work or relate? (still not sure relate is as important as work or action or focusing on purpose)

Rules:
- CWO/COW cannot have different purposes under them?  organizing captures or outputs merely complicates things?  well tags and linking are fine but doing strict 
- Use information organization systems to decide when to create additional KC or KO or even KW.  An additional KC could be another process, time based, etc.  Another KO could be created for a different system or different audience.  Another KW could be created for a different person/agent/entity working in the KMS.

(Meta,System) Tasks - use obsidian to show mocs or linking dynamically to tags
(KO) Homepage, README, Index, Welcome, HOME
(KC) Inbox, Drop, Dropzone
(KC) Clippings, Bookmarks, Highlights, Quotes, etc. - Obsidian Web Clipper or integrated clippers or bookmarks or whatever capture
    (KC + KW or KO or System) YouTube - we use KW (knowledge work) or KO (knowledge output) because this helps with other knowledge work (relating, organizing, retrieval) but also leaves a space for file explorer or audience in your published website to see YouTube clippings.  You can even see system being used with dynamic MoCs to organize or show dashboards for these clippings
    (KC + KW or KO) Articles
    (KC + KW or KO) Unorganized, Inbox, Archive Unstructured, DROP - notice this is not output 
(KO + maybe system) 01 - Projects - could use johnny decimal to let someone find categories of things you do in your work or content you're sharing.  system can be used to show MoCs and such or use tags to automatically fill out the folders
     (KO + maybe system or KW) 01.0 Project example
(KO) 02 - Cybersecurity Tools
(KO) 03 - Cybersecurity Frameworks
(KW + maybe system) Daily Notes - could be organized with folder or file names or by the system (like obsidian plugins and such) or it could rely on tagging
(System or maybe KO) _excalidraw
(KO) Resume.md - recruiter audience 
(KW + system tools for knowledge work) PARA, e-ACCESS, Zettelkasten, ACE, ARCO

## PKM (personal knowledge management) knowledge work only in obsidian

if this system is only used by you and stays in obsidian then some good options could be:

- zettelkasten type system if you do research type work a lot (lots of time to get used to)

- an action oriented organization (para, e-ACCESS, time based, etc.)

- there's no need to structure or organize by content because that is hard and no one except you would consume it.  you're a gardener at that point and not a librarian

you would need to use links especially and tags a good bit along with any other higher level components like MoCs which links several pages together into a topic.

# All of the opinionated structures I've seen / ideas

Use these as components for building your own system.

MOST of these are oriented towards knowledge work.  use them like Legos and put them under an ontology, top level, or wherever works best.  they are great for action and project oriented work.  however the short term and long term action relations are the hardest part to manage in these systems. you can throw everything into the big archive or use an archive per folder.

- ACE
    - Atlas - mocs and mapping to things - ontologies
    - Calendar - time based
    - Efforts - action oriented

- e-ACCESS - knowledge at top and action at bottom
    - Encounters (cooling pad, unsorted)
    - A - Atlas - mocs, dashboards, directories, overviews, consumption
    - C - Calendar - daily, meetings, journals
    - C - Cards - ideas, things, concepts, statements, atomic
    - E - Extras - support materials and images
    - S - Sources - clippings, articles, sources
    - S - Spaces - areas of life - spaces have their own PARAs or other organizational structure 

- ACE
    - A - Atlas
    - C - calendar
    - E - Efforts

- PARA
    - PROJECTS
    - AREAS
    - RESOURCES
    - ARCHIVE

- Flat with naming scheme
    - only good top level if you just need your system for knowledge work and not integration with other systems or for external consumption.  
    - this is risky it would seem.  you may hit some bottlenecks in the workflow
    - if you have a really good naming system that uses dates or an if or naming code system at the front then this can be doable 
    - not good if you need to access outside of obsidian a lot or have other people look through it

- Time based with name scheme
    - 4 folders - now soon later archive
    - file names like "year, month, topic, keyword"
