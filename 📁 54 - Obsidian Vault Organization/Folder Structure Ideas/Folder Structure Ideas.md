# My ideas for systems

## Contributable knowledge hub that doubles for PKM (the hybrid system) - a system for knowledge output, communication, integration, and compatibility 

this is the hardest system to figure out.  I've tried thinking of the best way to do it, so here's my take

- this system should let you rapidly do knowledge capture and knowledge work building your second brain.  however, the goal here is to also have a "storefront" or organized library for consumption for some audience or even just for other information systems.  for instance this can help if you have 
- the reason for a library is to enable information retrieval for certain folks (hence the term "folksonomies").  This could be your family, yourself, an audience or community online, or whomever.  you could even have different libraries/storefronts/organized information interfaces for working in file explorer and more. this is where organizing by content and not by process becomes helpful.  any structured information organization system is a component you can use within this but we also have the other systems for knowledge work and capture.  the point of this system is to enable both to work in harmony.

### folder structure example 1

this applies to:
- windows OS
- English file order or collation (helps with alphabetical order)
- knowledge work
- 

> there are three labels I will use: KO (knowledge output to some entity, system, or audience), KC (knowledge capture from some entity, system, process, etc.), and KW (knowledge work, organization, etc.)

maybe add a fourth for relating or meta organization?  in terms of purposes for things in the vault.  this could also be called system/meta/organizing/relating

these are the three purposes you can apply to a top level folder (still deciding on if this applies to lower levels and if they can differ as you go down). MAYBE you can add but can't take away as you go down.

The COW approach (capture, output, work/purpose/action) or some other term we will find for a good acronym

maybe COWS? - CAPTURE OUTPUT WORK (+SYSTEM)
maybe WORCS - work,output,relate,capture,system

This is essentially the same basic process of ARC from Nick Milo (add, relate, communicate) but definitely slightly different.  work doesn't have to be relating things.

capture or add - these can be organized to a degree but you should avoid organizing in this space with folders except by going down one level.  limit organizing down to one additional folder level
work or relate? (still not sure relate is as important as work or action or focusing on purpose)



## PKM (personal knowledge management) knowledge work only in obsidian

if this system is only used by you and stays in obsidian then some good options could be:

- zettelkasten type system if you do research type work a lot (lots of time to get used to)

- an action oriented organization (para, e-ACCESS, time based, etc.)

- there's no need to structure or organize by content because that is hard and no one except you would consume it.  you're a gardener at that point and not a librarian

you would need to use links especially and tags a good bit along with any other higher level components like MoCs which links several pages together into a topic.
