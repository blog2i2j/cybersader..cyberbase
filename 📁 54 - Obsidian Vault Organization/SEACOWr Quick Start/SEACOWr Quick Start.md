[Knowledge Platform Organization Meta-Framework](../Knowledge%20Platform%20Organization%20Meta-Framework/Knowledge%20Platform%20Organization%20Meta-Framework.md)

> [!tldr] Seacowr gives you a language to use and a mental model for building structures for knowledge in your KMS

To use the [SEACOWr Framework](../Knowledge%20Platform%20Organization%20Meta-Framework/Knowledge%20Platform%20Organization%20Meta-Framework.md) to build your knowledge organization system, you will need to:
1) **A set of rules** involving allowed relationships between knowledge system/platform components
	1) Look at the [SEACOWr Framework](../Knowledge%20Platform%20Organization%20Meta-Framework/Knowledge%20Platform%20Organization%20Meta-Framework.md) for more details on the components (System, Entity, and Activities - Capture, Output, Work, and Relation)
2) **A set of goals** for entities using the knowledge system or platform 
3) Define **system context, components, logic, capabilities, or limitations** that need to be considered

What SEACOW actually is: A meta-framework / lens for analyzing and designing ANY organizational structure. It asks:

  - System — What platform/technology constraints exist?
  - Entity — WHO accesses this? (teams, individuals, agents, audiences)
  - Activities:
    - Capture — WHERE/HOW does information enter?
    - Output — WHERE/HOW does information exit to consumers?
    - Work — WHERE/HOW is information processed/used?
    - (r)elation — HOW are things connected across the structure?

# SEACOW Rule Setting

You must define rules with language relating to or in terms of:
- SEACOW(r) components - (System, Entity, Activities → Capture, Output, Work, (r)elation)
- Knowledge system/platform structures/logic/context
	- Descriptions relating to aspects of knowledge system structures (graph, hierarchical, nested) (e.g. depth)
	- Length of knowledge structure
	- Identification of knowledge structures (e.g. naming schemes)
- Use words like:
	- Knowledge for the thing that's being structured
	- SEACOW components for the acronym items
	- Nested (hierarchical, structured) or Flat for knowledge structure shapes
