# OLD notes

Use these as components for building your own system.

MOST of these are oriented towards knowledge work.  use them like Legos and put them under an ontology, top level, or wherever works best.  they are great for action and project oriented work.  however the short term and long term action relations are the hardest part to manage in these systems. you can throw everything into the big archive or use an archive per folder.

- ACE
    - Atlas - mocs and mapping to things - ontologies
    - Calendar - time based
    - Efforts - action oriented

- e-ACCESS - knowledge at top and action at bottom
    - Encounters (cooling pad, unsorted)
    - A - Atlas - mocs, dashboards, directories, overviews, consumption
    - C - Calendar - daily, meetings, journals
    - C - Cards - ideas, things, concepts, statements, atomic
    - E - Extras - support materials and images
    - S - Sources - clippings, articles, sources
    - S - Spaces - areas of life - spaces have their own PARAs or other organizational structure 

- ACE
    - A - Atlas
    - C - calendar
    - E - Efforts

- PARA
    - PROJECTS
    - AREAS
    - RESOURCES
    - ARCHIVE

- Flat with naming scheme
    - only good top level if you just need your system for knowledge work and not integration with other systems or for external consumption.  
    - this is risky it would seem.  you may hit some bottlenecks in the workflow
    - if you have a really good naming system that uses dates or an if or naming code system at the front then this can be doable 
    - not good if you need to access outside of obsidian a lot or have other people look through it

- Time based with name scheme
    - 4 folders - now soon later archive
    - file names like "year, month, topic, keyword"
