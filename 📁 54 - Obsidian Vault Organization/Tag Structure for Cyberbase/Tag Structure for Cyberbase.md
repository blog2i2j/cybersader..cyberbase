# My Tagging Structure

- `#<>` - 

# Ideas

Tagging hacks
- emojis take long to use but easy to find scrolling
- emojis can appear before or after ASCII 
Patterns of characters are easy to type but limited like "---" and you should limit categories alphabetically for sea cow 
Break up tagging by entities like personal vs just system

Seacowr gives you a language to use and a mental model

Seacowr rule definition components
- structures/logic/context
- direction or data structures (graph, hierarchical, nested)
- length 
- seacowr attributes/states/components (SEACOWr)

My seacowr rules for tagging
- CAPTURE tags logic/context/structure cannot house nested tags more than 2 deep
- OUTPUT tags can have nested knowledge structures/tags but they can only RELATE to knowledge WORK and knowledge shall not be moved between them
- All CAPTURE categories with the interface/ENTITY directly as the person (daily notes, encounters, etc.) must reside in a flat structure.
- RELATION for CAPTURE content will be limited to flat tags and not nested ontologies unless being applicable to OUTPUT tag taxonomies in line with folders

System components of obsidian tagging for consideration:
- sorting
- typability and emoji keyboards
- nesting
- visual and recognition while scrolling
- system capability (OS and GitHub)

For my example I want this system to make it easy to type what's accessed most, work with GitHub, have consistent sorting, and be explorable with the clustered parts being at the bottom.

Example now:

_/ or _ - sorting good and typing harder
-/ or - sorting good and typing good
/ Sorting bad? And typing good
Emojis - sorting down more and typing bad can be the lowest too for secretive or hard to find rare cases 
#word - sorting down far and typing easy

Structure based on seacowr and other structures

Capture #_or-clippings
Output #_/ or -/ system compatible?
Relation #word
Entity/work for multiple people or groups #--group/projects or para folders
