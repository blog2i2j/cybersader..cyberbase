[Plugin Development](../../📁%2010%20-%20My%20Obsidian%20Stack/Plugin%20Development/Plugin%20Development.md) - could develop a plugin for it
[Dynamic Tags Based on Folder](../Dynamic%20Tags%20Based%20on%20Folder/Dynamic%20Tags%20Based%20on%20Folder.md) - the opposite of this (automate tag based on folder)

- Auto Note Mover does this but not in a smart way

Add a system that decides when to dynamically move something to a different folder based on tags.  The system could have a priority structure or could even duplicate links or leave behind embedding versions in folders that they leave.  This would help solve the problem of strict hierarchies that you get with a hierarchical system like folders versus and emulated graph system like overlapping tag paths or links (pretty much a graph edge representation).  Ultimately, the problem still becomes that you need folders.
