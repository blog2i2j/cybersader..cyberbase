[Dynamic Folders Based on Tags](../Automate%20Folders%20Based%20on%20Tags/Dynamic%20Folders%20Based%20on%20Tags.md) - the opposite of this
[Using Tags](../../📁%2010%20-%20My%20Obsidian%20Stack/Using%20Tags/Using%20Tags.md)
[Plugin Development](../../📁%2010%20-%20My%20Obsidian%20Stack/Plugin%20Development/Plugin%20Development.md) - could develop a plugin for it

- Automatic Tags plugin

Be awesome if I could say anything the regex matches this in folder path gets a converted tag based on the path to snake case.

Could use a DataView query at the top of the page?  Potentially or the bottom with a template for it when it matches that regex I talked about.  That would be dangerous to run often.  Not really an option.  Should only change when changes to folder structure are made.
