# WO(R)C(S)/COW: Organizing Your Second Brain from First Principles

**Effective knowledge platforms** like Obsidian, Notion, or a simple folder system work best when structured around your needs – not a one-size-fits-all template. As one knowledge manager noted, no single method fits everyone; your ideal setup is unique to the work you do and knowledge you manage ​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/1f1og13/second_brain_recommendation/#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20one%20tool%20is%20not,usability). Instead of rigid rules, the WORCS (or COWS) framework encourages you to think from **first principles** – define your system based on its purpose and audience before deciding on folders, tags, or any tool-specific setup. WORCS stands for **Work, Output, Reference, Capture, System** (sometimes simplified to **COWS** without the “Reference” component). Each term represents a role that information can play in your “second brain.” By understanding these components, you can design a knowledge structure that **fits your workflow**, whether it’s a personal notes vault, a team wiki, or a publishable knowledge base.
