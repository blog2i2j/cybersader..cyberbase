[Using Tags](../../📁%2010%20-%20My%20Obsidian%20Stack/Using%20Tags/Using%20Tags.md)

the workflow
- ARC - add, relate, communicate

# Ideas

## folders

### good ways to structure folders

- most to least actionable (e.g. PARA)
- meta folders before or after (e.g. obsidian utils)
- MoC files to link or map a tag based ontology
- separate by the part of the workflow (ARC) (e.g. Inbox, MoCs, Hierachies/Docs)
- dont organize time manually and granularly.  have an archive under time where you can throw those.  that means dont duplicate time based under some archived focused folder
- do you duplicate ontologies under archives or no?
- use folders to structure the knowledge work process and not the content
- structure for recall

### the high level structuring priorities

- make sense for the audience
- order of high level should mean something
    - based off of LATCH
        - Location Alphabet Time Category (cluster) Hierarchy (ontology)

### root level folder ideas

- para
- ace
- efforts, journal/time, knowledge (EJK)

### folder notes or no?

- without enforcing them you have images above the note files
- enforcing them is hard though

### outputs, docs, audience

- if you have to, leave shorts cuts to the consumable and deliverable parts
- maps of content
- docs output areas sorted for different audiences
- MoCs for different audiences
- there's always the search bar

start simple then scale up or down as needed...srsly

## tags

just as folders need structures so do tags, but they can overlap

### good ways to structure tags

- by the content
- with unique names
- ontology based
- for clustering
- for filtering with mocs
- by the process
- by actionability
- for recall - LATCH components

### ideas for tag structures

- use underscore to auto complete into ontology or process focused tag structures
- use meta tag categories
- use a tag root for meta stuff for working in the vault
- 

### what's supported for tags?

https://help.obsidian.md/tags 

### tag case

- just use snake-case since double clicking and programming with the tag names becomes easier

### tag structure examples

- `_/unstructured categories or tags`
    - alphabetical or autocomplete sorting can also help here
- `(number or emoji)_word_here/ontologies`
    - or structured strictly where the alphabetical or chronoglocial naming helps
- `words/stuff` - based on information process or KMS process or functionality (e.g. clippings)
    - these have to be easy to remember
- `-/other_purpose`
- `--/yet_another_section`

if you need to use regular words for unstructured tags then you can hide some things in the underscore or dash tags

The first type of character helps with autocomplete
