# Organizing Your Second Brain from First Principles

## Start with Purpose and Audience (First Principles)

Begin by clarifying **why** you’re organizing knowledge and **who** it’s for. This will guide every structural decision:

- **Purpose:** Are you organizing notes for personal learning, managing project documentation, writing a book, or curating content to share online? 
- **Audience:** Is this system just for you, or will others consume it? A personal second brain can be looser (you might rely on search or ad-hoc links), but a team knowledge base or public wiki needs clear organization and naming. If you plan to integrate AI or automation, consistency becomes important so the AI can interpret your notes. Likewise, if you’ll publish notes (e.g. via Obsidian Publish or a Notion shared page), consider how outsiders navigate the content – that might mean a more intuitive folder layout or index.  This is where setting up a library-like interface may be what you have to do (structured ontologies of notes).

By focusing on purpose and audience first, you ensure your system’s design directly **serves your goals**. Now let’s break down the framework components and how to apply them with various platforms or systems.

## WO(R)C(S) Overview (potential framework acronym)

WORCS is similar to Nick Milo's ARC approach to personal knowledge management (PKM).  However, it's a simple idea that extends everywhere.  We want to make a good knowledge platform workflow and system, so we break it down by inputs, function, and outputs.  This is how engineers approach things and it's applicable here.  

I surmise that we can use the components of WORCS, COW, or COWS to organize the organizational components of our knowledge platforms (like Obsidian).  This is a first principles approach to maximizing the utility of these systems - no matter the context.  

We use WORCS to breakdown this framework into 5 potential components with 3 core components.  WORCS refers to knowledge WORK, knowledge OUTPUT, knowledge RELATION (not as important or "first principally"), knowledge CAPTURE, and knowledge SYSTEM (the system or context of the knowledge platform).  We can apply WORCS with rules to define how structure can emerge from our knowledge management system (KMS).  I'm still not sure that the RELATION part is fundamental enough to include.

## SEA(COWr) Overview

The “SEA(COWr)” model covers:

1. **S**ystem – The platform or technology context (e.g., Obsidian, Notion, etc.).
2. **E**ntity – The audience, user, or agent interacting with the knowledge.
3. **A**ctivities – The main types of operations on your knowledge platform.

Under **Activities**, we have four sub-components:

- **C**apture – How you get knowledge into the system.
- **O**utput – How you interface or communicate the knowledge to external systems, entities, or audiences.
- **W**ork – How you derive utility or process knowledge toward a goal.
- **r**elation – How you interlink knowledge or connect concepts (not a core component)

This framework breaks down how information flows into your platform (Capture), gets processed or related (Work, Relation), is eventually published or shared (Output), and is supported by the overall System and Entity context.

## Framework Breakdown

### 1st Layer: Framework Conceptual Components

#### SEA(COWr)

SEA(COW):
- knowledge SYSTEM
	- Refers to the knowledge platform or system itself which affects how all components are utilized (Obsidian or Notion would be examples of systems.
- ENTITY
	- Refers to who's utilizing the knowledge platform or knowledge in the system.  This context affects numerous aspects of how you design your system
- knowledge ACTIVITIES
	- knowledge CAPTURE
		- How you get knowledge into the platform
	- knowledge RELATION
		- Knowledge relation isn't necessarily a core activity of a knowledge platform.  This is why I put it in parentheses.  One could argue that RELATION is just part of knowledge work.  However, maybe you could have structures like (still not sure relate is as important as work or action or focusing on purpose)folders or tags specifically designed for bridging gaps between different activities in your knowledge platform.  It's debatable.
	- knowledge OUTPUT
		- Knowledge output refers to designing the platform or system in a way where knowledge can be retrieved by certain entities or outputted to other systems or entities such as outputting or exporting documents. It even refers to communicating the knowledge or creating a system that can be easily explored or interfaced with by other audiences or systems.
	- knowledge WORK
		- Knowledge work is where you derive utility from utilizing the system/platform in combination with the knowledge towards some goal

### 2nd Layer: Framework Application/Implementation

This is the harder part.  You have realize the implementation or design of the knowledge platform/system to use the framework.

There are two pieces:
- **Platform Capabilities** – e.g., how Obsidian handles folders, tags, and links vs. how Notion uses databases.
	- Understand the capabilities of the knowledge platform and how they can fulfill your goals for applicable conceptual components.
- **Defined Rules** – consistent guidelines for how you name folders, create hierarchical tags, or handle references.
	- Define rules on the knowledge system/platform that involve the conceptual framework components

## Applying SEA(COWr) to Knowledge Platform Components (Files/Folders, Tags, etc.)

A big part of using SEA(COWr) effectively is applying consistent, purposeful rules to your system’s tools—whether you’re creating folder structures, tagging conventions, or wikis.

### Folder Structuring Example with Rules for Components (Obsidian)

#### Rules Example

- These are the three purposes you can apply to a top level folder (still deciding on if this applies to lower levels and if they can differ as you go down). MAYBE you can add but can't take away as you go down.
- Maybe a framework components (W-O-R-C-S or A-C-W-O-E) cannot have different purposes under them?  Organizing captures or outputs merely complicates things?  Well tags and linking are fine but doing strict is bad - this is where things get complicated.  Maybe you say this one has RELATION or maybe that's just a part of knowledge WORK.
- Use information organization systems to decide when to create additional CAPTURE or OUTPUT or even WORK.  An additional CAPTURE could be another process, time based, etc.  Another OUTPUT could be created for a different system or different audience.  Another WORK could be created for a different person/agent/entity working in the KMS.
- Use Audience and System to also help decide when additional structure (in this case, folders) need to be created.

#### Folder, File, and Naming Structure Example

Naming potentially over everything where needed:

(SYSTEM) MojiDex - use emojis to additionally sort folders and files (emojis are essentially numbers and can be used to interface well with alphabetically sorted systems like file explorer)

Folders:

(SYSTEM) Tasks - use obsidian to show mocs or linking dynamically to tags
(OUTPUT) Homepage, README, Index, Welcome, HOME
(CAPTURE) Inbox, Drop, Dropzone
(CAPTURE) Clippings, Bookmarks, Highlights, Quotes, etc. - Obsidian Web Clipper or integrated clippers or bookmarks or whatever capture
    (CAPTURE + WORK or OUTPUT) YouTube - we use WORK (knowledge work) or OUTPUT (knowledge output) because this helps with other knowledge work (relating, organizing, retrieval) but also leaves a space for file explorer or audience in your published website to see YouTube clippings.  You can even see system being used with dynamic MoCs to organize or show dashboards for these clippings
    (CAPTURE + WORK or OUTPUT) Articles
    (CAPTURE + WORK or OUTPUT) Unorganized, Inbox, Archive Unstructured, DROP - notice this is not output 
(OUTPUT + maybe system) 01 - Projects - could use johnny decimal to let someone find categories of things you do in your work or content you're sharing.  system can be used to show MoCs and such or use tags to automatically fill out the folders
     (OUTPUT + maybe system or KW) 01.0 Project example
(OUTPUT) 02 - Cybersecurity Tools
(OUTPUT) 03 - Cybersecurity Frameworks
(KW + SYSTEM) Daily Notes - could be organized with folder or file names or by the system (like obsidian plugins and such) or it could rely on tagging
(SYSTEM or maybe OUTPUT) _excalidraw
(OUTPUT) Resume.md - recruiter audience 
(WORK + SYSTEM) PARA, e-ACCESS, Zettelkasten, ACE, ARCO

### Isn't PARA enough?

SEA(COWr) is a [meta-framework](../../⬇️%20Clippings/ChatGPT/Meta-framework/Meta-framework.md) for building folder structures like PARA. 

For example, PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) can meet certain needs but often lacks explicit layers for:

- **Output** – A place for final deliverables or public-facing content.
- **Relation** – Specific linking strategies like MOCs or bridging notes.
- **Entity** – Addressing multiple audiences (personal vs. team vs. public).

SEA(COWe) helps ensure each piece—System, Entity, and Activities (Capture, Output, Work, and relations)—receives conscious design attention in your knowledge platform.  PARA could still apply here, but you may have to adapt the PARA structure to those needs.  That's where SEA(COWr) can help you remember what to focus on.
