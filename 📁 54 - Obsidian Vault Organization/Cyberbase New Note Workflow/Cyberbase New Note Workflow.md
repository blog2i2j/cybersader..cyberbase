## My QuickAdd Workflow

This is dependent on my [Folder Structure](../Cyberbase%20Folder%20Structure/Cyberbase%20Folder%20Structure.md).  

Automating New Notes with QuickAdd Templates:
- Current folder
	- This would be useful if adding to one of the [OUTPUT type (public facing)](../SEACOWr%20Quick%20Start/SEACOWr%20Quick%20Start.md) folders
- Specific folders
	- 🕸️ UNSTRUCTURED
	- ⬇️ INBOX, DROPZONE

### Folder Notes Compatibility

- Automatically create folder notes
	- This setting breaks the link appending feature with QuickAdd

### Modal to Add Tags During Creation

Creatin/created a macro for selecting tags - [QuickAdd Tag Selector](🕸️%20UNSTRUCTURED/QuickAdd%20Tag%20Selector/QuickAdd%20Tag%20Selector.md)
