	- Elm Hill RV
		- [The cliffs at Elm Hill RV resort are open and active. We anchored near there last weekend and my kids (teens) swam over to jump off them. They aren't that high. And I am not aware of any deaths at this spot. It's ~ 90ft deep right there. To get there take 40W past the airport to Stewart's Ferry Pike. Take a right off the interstate and Elm Hill is 1-2 miles on the left. Take the second Elm Hill entrance for the cliffs. There is a more dangerous spot across the lake. Don't go to that one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/ojtonr/anyone_know_where_this_is_specifically_know_cliff/ "Anyone know where this is specifically? know cliff jumping spots? : r/nashville")
