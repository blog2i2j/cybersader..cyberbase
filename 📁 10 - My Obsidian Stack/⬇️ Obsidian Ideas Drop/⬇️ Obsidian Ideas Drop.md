# Custom Plugins

[Obsidian Plugins and Ideas for Contributions](../../📁%2051%20-%20Cyberbase/Obsidian%20Plugins%20and%20Ideas%20for%20Contributions/Obsidian%20Plugins%20and%20Ideas%20for%20Contributions.md)

- Plugin that can use parent folders to add/prepend (even w/regex) the parent folders to the title of a note to create additional aliases
- Plugin that makes pretty permalinks based on wiki page name and duplicates in the vault
- Plugin that uses AI to ask you about your day and smartly write and log about it for you in a daily note either through voice or text chat
- Modify refactor plugin to have 
	- option for copying md to README.md for github applicability
	- Ability to add sub folders or pages from within note like Notion
- Youtube links
	- [Embed YouTube Videos in Notes & Link Timestamps to Embedded Video - Feature archive - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/embed-youtube-videos-in-notes-link-timestamps-to-embedded-video/36779/4) 
- Look for plugins that generate ascii, markdown, HTML with styles, and plaintext
	- Timeline plugin like this?
- Auto headings and bullets?
- Plugin to automatically put bullet point when clicking directly below a bullet list
- Plugin that does certain syntax to show page and heading when pasting link to page and heading

  - If this doesn't work then look at how other in-the-browser code editors are safe and if they could somehow be implemented
- Obsidian GitHub action for running code like a vault would
- StackEdit with GitHub as alternative to Github.dev?
- Family tree in Obsidian?
- 
- Linting for filenames and folders to make sure that they work on Windows (No ":" and other characters)
